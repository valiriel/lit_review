We analyzed species richness in these new patches in comparison to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. When taking as reference Fragmented patches (that exhibit an extinction debt) or all old patches (Fragmented and Stable), we concluded to the occurrence of a colonization credit in New patches. However, when the reference is Stable patches (the less likely to exhibit an extinction debt) alone, no colonization credit could be detected. Moreover, correspondence analysis revealed that New patches were similar to old patches in term of species composition. These results are encouraging for restoration programs.

However, these ecosystems have suffered from fragmentation and destruction during the last century. We studied the response of calcareous grassland plant diversity to landscape changes in Belgium. Results indicated that high area loss (since 1965) old habitat patches exhibited an extinction debt inverse to low area loss old habitat patches, little depending on the area loss threshold (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%) considered for the distinction between the high and low area loss patches. However, human activities also created new habitat patches in the landscape and therefore provided opportunities for calcareous grassland plant species to colonize new habitats. This also provided opportunities to study species colonization abilities in the context of habitat restoration. We analyzed species richness in new patches compared to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. We detected the presence of a colonization credit in new patches when using high loss old patches (area loss>80%, exhibiting an extinction debt) or all old patches as a reference. However, when the reference was low loss old patches alone (area loss<80%, less likely to exhibit an extinction debt), no colonization credit was detected. In addition, species composition was similar between new patches and old patches. These results are encouraging for restoration programs. However, the results indicated that the presence of an extinction debt in reference habitats could lead to inaccurate conclusions in restoration monitoring. Therefore, extinction debt should be considered when choosing reference habitats to evaluate restoration success. ; Peer reviewed","Belgium ; Calcareous grassland ; Colonization credit ; Extinction debt ; Vascular plants ; Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-011-9611-5","2011","Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2011 JUL","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","26","6","823","836","10.1007/s10980-011-9611-5","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000291485400005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Piqueray, Julien et al.

For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in 'extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and 'colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.","CLIMATE-CHANGE ; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS ; VEGETATION STRUCTURE ; MODELS ; FOREST ; BIODIVERSITY ; PERSPECTIVE ; THRESHOLDS ; DIVERSITY ; DYNAMICS","https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/publications/extinction-debt-and-colonization-credit-delay-range-shifts-of-eastern-north-american-trees(4788d867-b614-465b-9d20-f45cd3777806).html","2017","Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2017 JUL","NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","1","7",NA,NA,"10.1038/s41559-017-0182","2397-334X","WOS:000417179000011","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Article","BERLIN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Talluto, Matthew V. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Kitzes, Justin and Harte, John","Predicting extinction debt from community patterns","Abstract ; A significant challenge in both measuring and predicting species extinction rates at global and local scales is the possibility of extinction debt, time-delayed extinctions that occur gradually following an initial impact. Here we examine how relative abundance distributions and spatial aggregation combine to influence the likely magnitude of future extinction debt following habitat loss or climate-driven range contraction. Our analysis is based on several fundamental premises regarding abundance distributions, most importantly that species abundances immediately following habitat loss are a sample from an initial relative abundance distribution and that the long-term, steady-state form of the species abundance distribution is a property of the biology of a community and not of area. Under these two hypotheses, the results show that communities following canonical lognormal and broken-stick abundance distributions are prone to exhibit extinction debt, especially when species exhibit low spatial aggregation. Conversely, communities following a logseries distribution with a constant Fisher's Î± parameter never demonstrate extinction debt and often show an â€œimmigration credit,â€ in which species richness rises in the long term following an initial decrease. An illustration of these findings in 25 biodiversity hotspots suggests a negligible immediate extinction rate for bird communities and eventual extinction debts of 30â€“50% of initial species richness, whereas plant communities are predicted to immediately lose 5â€“15% of species without subsequent extinction debt. These results shed light on the basic determinants of extinction debt and provide initial indications of the magnitude of likely debts in landscapes where few empirical data are available.","Environmental Science ; Ecology","https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.C.3307872.V1","2016","Figshare","2015 AUG","ECOLOGY","96","8","2127","2136","10.1890/14-1594.1","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000358454500011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kitzes, Justin et al.

(Ferran), 1953- and Pino i Vilalta, Joan","Assessing coexisting plant extinction debt and colonization credit in a grasslandâ€“forest change gradient","Changes in species richness along the ecological succession gradient may be strongly determined by coexisting extinction debts of species from the original habitats and colonization credits of those from the replacing habitats. The magnitude of these processes and their causes remain largely unknown. We explored the extinction debt and colonization credit for grassland and forest specialist plants, respectively, and the local and landscape factors associated to the richness of these species groups in a 50-year process of forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean grasslands. A set of sampling plots of persistent grasslands and forests and their transitional habitat (wooded grasslands) was selected within fixed-area sites distributed across the landscape. Our results confirm the extinction debt and suggest colonization credit (according to observed trends and model predictions) in wooded grasslands when compared to persistent forests, despite wooded grasslands and persistent forests having similar tree cover. Grassland connectivity and solar radiation had opposing effects on the richness of both grassland and forest specialists, and it is possible that the availability of seed sources from old forests may have accelerate the payment of colonization credit in the wooded grasslands. These results suggest that extinction debt and colonization credit have driven species turnover during the 50 years of forest encroachment, but at different rates, and that local and landscape factors have opposing effects on these two phenomena. They also highlight the importance of documenting biodiversity time lags following habitat change when they are still in progress in order to timely and adequately manage habitats of high conservation value such as the grasslands studied here.","Biodiversity change ; Habitat change ; Mediterranean grasslands ; Variegated landscape ; Vascular plants","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3377-4","2015","Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2015 NOV","OECOLOGIA","179","3","823","834","10.1007/s00442-015-3377-4","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000363559800019","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Bagaria MoratÃ³, Guillem et al.

"JOUR","en","Isbell, Forest and Tilman, David and Polasky, Stephen and Loreau, Michel","The biodiversity-dependent ecosystem service debt","International audience ; Habitat destruction is driving biodiversity loss in remaining ecosystems, and ecosystem functioning and services often directly depend on biodiversity. Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversityâ€dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c. 2â€“21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversityâ€dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.","biodiversity conservation ; biodiversityâ€“ecosystem functioning relationships ; carbon storage and sequestration ; ecological production function ; economic valuation ; extinction debt ; global ecoregions ; habitat destruction ; natural capital ; social cost of carbon ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology","https://hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02962330","2015","HAL CCSD ; Wiley","2015 FEB","ECOLOGY LETTERS","18","2","119","134","10.1111/ele.12393","1461-023X and 1461-0248","WOS:000348719900001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Isbell, Forest et al.

"JOUR","eng","Naaf, Tobias and Kolk, Jens","Colonization credit of post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany remains 130â€“230 years after reforestation","In many temperate regions worldwide, a large portion of deciduous forest grows on former agricultural land, while a smaller portion is 'ancient' forest on sites with no historical record of agricultural land use. The differences in species diversity between ancient and post-agricultural forests have been well documented. However, in regions where forest fragmentation occurred only a few centuries ago, it remains unclear whether these differences are due to an extinction debt in ancient forests (i.e., a delay in local species extinction), a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests (i.e., species are yet to colonize a patch), or both. Additionally, our knowledge on how soil conditions and landscape configuration interact with species' traits to determine the colonization credit is limited. Here, we surveyed ancient and post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany to quantify the magnitude of the colonization credit and identify its determinants. The colonization credit in an average forest patch amounted to 4.7 forest specialist species and ranged up to 9 species in highly isolated patches. In contrast, we found more species than predicted in patches better connected to ancient forests. The colonization credit was not smaller in older patches than it was in younger ones. Species with a low dispersal potential and a low seed output contributed most to the colonization credit. Our study demonstrates that in a landscape where the extinction debt has already been paid and only a small fraction of ancient forest is left, the recovery of forest specialist diversity in post-agricultural forests may take several centuries.

However, to what degree these shifts lag behind current climate change, and to what extent delayed extinctions and colonizations contribute to these shifts, are under debate. Here, we calculate extinction debt and colonization credit of 135 species from the European Alps by comparing species distribution models with 1576 re-surveyed plots. We find extinction debt in 60% and colonization credit in 38% of the species, and at least one of the two in 93%. This suggests that the realized niche of very few of the 135 species fully tracks climate change. As expected, extinction debts occur below and colonization credits occur above the optimum elevation of species. Colonization credits are more frequent in warmth-demanding species from lower elevations with lower dispersal capability, and extinction debts are more frequent in cold-adapted species from the highest elevations. Local extinctions hence appear to be already pending for those species which have the least opportunity to escape climate warming. ; ISSN:2041-1723","General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology ; General Physics and Astronomy ; General Chemistry","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6754411/","2019","Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2019 SEP 20","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","10",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41467-019-12343-x","2041-1723","WOS:000486995200003","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rumpf, Sabine B. et al.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how current woody plant species distribution, composition and richness related to historical and present land uses. Location: A smallholder farming landscape in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1 ha sites in farmland, and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted versus permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognised conservation values, though apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in southwestern Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaic - similarly to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.

"JOUR","en","Chen, Youhua and Shen, Tsung-Jen","A general framework for predicting delayed responses of ecological communities to habitat loss","Abstract Although biodiversity crisis at different spatial scales has been well recognised, the phenomena of extinction debt and immigration credit at a crossing-scale context are, at best, unclear. Based on two community patterns, regional species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial abundance distribution (SAAD), Kitzes and Harte (2015) presented a macroecological framework for predicting post-disturbance delayed extinction patterns in the entire ecological community. In this study, we further expand this basic framework to predict diverse time-lagged effects of habitat destruction on local communities. Specifically, our generalisation of KHâ€™s model could address the questions that could not be answered previously: (1) How many species are subjected to delayed extinction in a local community when habitat is destructed in other areas? (2) How do rare or endemic species contribute to extinction debt or immigration credit of the local community? (3) How will species differ between two local areas? From the demonstrations using two SAD models (single-parameter lognormal and logseries), the predicted patterns of the debt, credit, and change in the fraction of unique species can vary, but with consistencies and depending on several factors. The general framework deepens the understanding of the theoretical effects of habitat loss on community dynamic patterns in local samples.","Animals ; Biodiversity ; Models ; Biological ; Population Dynamics ; Spatial Analysis ; Biota ; Extinction","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430564/","2017","Nature Publishing Group UK","2017 APR 20","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","7",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-017-01070-2","2045-2322","WOS:000424389800001","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Chen, Youhua et al.

Els retards de diverses dÃ¨cades, coneguts com a deute d'extinciÃ³ i crÃ¨dit de colonitzaciÃ³, sÃ³n habituals desprÃ©s dels canvis en els usos del sÃ²l.

D'altra banda, el paper dels atributs de les plantes com a mediadors de l'extinciÃ³ d'espÃ¨cies de l'hÃ bitat previ (CapÃ­tol 3), i els mecanismes poblacionals i individuals del retard en l'extinciÃ³ d'un dels especialistes de prat mÃ©s freqÃ¼ents (Aphyllanthes monspeliensis; CapÃ­tol 4) han estat abordats desprÃ©s del canvi en l'hÃ bitat.

Tot i que han passat mÃ©s de 50 anys des de l'inici d'aquest procÃ©s de forestalitzaciÃ³ dels prats, s'ha detectat un important deute d'extinciÃ³ per als especialistes de prat i crÃ¨dit de colonitzaciÃ³ per als especialistes de bosc. El deute d'extinciÃ³ tambÃ© ha estat confirmat per l'especialista de prat A. monspeliensis, ja que la seva abundÃ ncia depÃ¨n de la connectivitat passada perÃ² no de l'actual. A mÃ©s a mÃ©s, un efecte rescat des dels prats circumdants i un lent decaÃ¯ment vegetatiu i reproductiu desprÃ©s del deteriorament de l'hÃ bitat han estat identificats com a mecanismes que afavoreixen el deute d'extinciÃ³.

Time lags of several decades, known as extinction debt and colonisation credit, often occur after land-use change events. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies addressing community assembly taking into account both extinction debt for habitat specialists of the former habitat and colonisation credit for habitat specialists of the new habitat. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, to address the drivers and mechanisms of time-lagged effects of habitat and landscape change on plant communities in semi-natural Mediterranean calcareous grasslands from a comprehensive approach, taking both changes in species richness and composition and their potential time lags into account. Extinction debt and colonisation credit are quantified after several decades of habitat change, and their drivers are investigated (Chapter 1). In order to disentangle the processes behind community change, the patterns and drivers of species extinctions and colonisations that already occurred are investigated through the two components of Î²-diversity: species replacement and richness differences (Chapter 2). Moreover, the role of plant traits in mediating extinctions of species of the former habitat (Chapter 3), and the population and individual-level mechanisms of extinction delay for one of the most frequent grassland specialists (Aphyllanthes monspeliensis; Chapter 4) are assessed after habitat change. The studies were conducted in the southern mountains of Catalonia (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), where forest encroachment occurred following grazing reduction during the second half of the 20th century. Although more than 50 years elapsed since the beginning of forest encroachment into these grasslands, both an important extinction debt for grassland specialists and colonisation credit for forest specialists are detected. Extinction debt was also confirmed for the grassland specialist A. monspeliensis, since its abundance depends on historical but not current connectivity. In addition, a rescue effect from surrounding grasslands and a slow vegetative and reproductive decay after habitat deterioration were identified as mechanisms enhancing extinction debt. Colonisation credit of forest plants, in turn, was probably maintained by dispersal limitation. Although species richness changed little after forest encroachment, high species replacement for the whole community occurred, resulting from idiosyncratic grassland specialists' extinctions and forest specialists' colonisations. However, while habitat fragmentation negatively affected some grassland specialists, no clear role of plant traits was found in mediating extinctions of this group. A generalised loss of grassland species and gain of forest species, resulting from the payment of extinction debt and colonisation credit, is expected to continue in the studied area even if no further forest encroachment occurs.","Riquesa d'espÃ¨cies ; riqueza de especies ; Species richness ; Beta-diversitat ; Beta-diversidad ; Beta-diversity ; Atributs biolÃ²gics ; Atributos biolÃ²gicos ; Life-history traits ; CiÃ¨ncies Experimentals ; 5","http://hdl.handle.net/10803/295705","2015","[Barcelona] : Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Bagaria MoratÃ³, Guillem et al.

We compared composition of herbaceous plant species occurred between 1987-1991 and 2012-2013. In Ohyachi,eight species ofpteridophyte belonging to seven families and 40 species ofangiosperm belonging to 21 families became extinct. Manyoftheextinct species belonged to Brassicaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae. In Aoba-chuo, four species of pteridophyte (four families) and 22 species of angiosperm (13 families)became extinct. Many of the extinct species belonged to Asteraceae. In Ohyachiand Aoba-chuo,28angiosperm species (17families)and 32angiosperm species (18 families) immigrated, respectively. Many of the immigrated species in both Ohyachi and Aoba-chuo belonged to Asteraceae and Poaceae of angiosperm. Most of the immigrated species in both forests belonged to ruderal species or exotic species. Forest fragmentation occurred at 1958 in Ohyachi and at 1963 in Aoba-chuo. This study could verify that extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants occur 32-55 years after forest fragmentation in Ohyachi and 28-50 after in Aoba-chuo. This study will contribute to estimating date for accounting extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants in fragmented forests and to detecting the causes and the effects of them, which are required for the protection of herbaceous plants in urbanized areas of Sapporo.","çµ¶æ»…ã®é…ã‚Œ ; åˆ†æ–­æ— ; ç”Ÿæ¯åœ°æ–­ç‰‡åŒ– ; è‰æœ¬ç¨® ; ç§»å…¥ã®é…ã‚Œ ; Extinction debt ; Fragmented forest ; Habitat fragmentation ; Herbaceous plant ; Immigration","https://scu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=77","2014","æœ­å¹Œå¸‚ç«‹å¤§å­¦",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"æ¾ç”° å²³å£« et al.

In this article, we propose the concept of â€˜â€˜colonization creditâ€™â€™ (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25â€“55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time. ; Peer reviewed","Colonization credit ; Habitat restoration ; Heathlands ; Life history traits ; Plant species richness ; Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/17944","2010","WILEY","2010 SEP","RESTORATION ECOLOGY","18","5","645","655","10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00495.x","1061-2971 and 1526-100X","WOS:000281552500004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cristofoli, Sara et al.

"THES","eng","Kolk, Jens (M. Sc.)","The long-term legacy of historical land cover changes ; Die Langzeitfolgen historischer LandbedeckungsverÃ¤nderungen","Over the last years there is an increasing awareness that historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies may be important drivers for present-day species richness and biodiversity due to time-delayed extinctions or colonizations in response to historical environmental changes. Historically altered habitat patches may therefore exhibit an extinction debt or colonization credit and can be expected to lose or gain species in the future. However, extinction debts and colonization credits are difficult to detect and their actual magnitudes or payments have rarely been quantified because species richness patterns and dynamics are also shaped by recent environmental conditions and recent environmental changes. In this thesis we aimed to determine patterns of herb-layer species richness and recent species richness dynamics of forest herb layer plants and link those patterns and dynamics to historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies. The study was conducted in the Prignitz, NE-Germany, where the forest distribution remained stable for the last ca. 100 years but where a) the deciduous forest area had declined by more than 90 per cent (leaving only remnants of ""ancient forests""), b) small new forests had been established on former agricultural land (""post-agricultural forests""). Here, we analyzed the relative importance of land use history and associated historical land cover changes for herb layer species richness compared to recent environmental factors and determined magnitudes of extinction debt and colonization credit and their payment in ancient and post-agricultural forests, respectively. We showed that present-day species richness patterns were still shaped by historical land cover changes that ranged back to more than a century. Although recent environmental conditions were largely comparable we found significantly more forest specialists, species with short-distance dispersal capabilities and clonals in ancient forests than in post-agricultural forests. Those species richness differences were largely contingent to a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests that ranged up to 9 species (average 4.7), while the extinction debt in ancient forests had almost completely been paid. Environmental legacies from historical agricultural land use played a minor role for species richness differences. Instead, patch connectivity was most important. Species richness in ancient forests was still dependent on historical connectivity, indicating a last glimpse of an extinction debt, and the colonization credit was highest in isolated post-agricultural forests. In post-agricultural forests that were better connected or directly adjacent to ancient forest patches the colonization credit was way smaller and we were able to verify a gradual payment of the colonization credit from 2.7 species to 1.5 species over the last six decades. ; In den vergangenen Jahren reift immer mehr die Erkenntnis, dass historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen und deren Folgewirkungen einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die heutige Artenvielfalt und BiodiversitaÌˆt haben koÌˆnnen. In Habitaten, deren Landnutzung und FlaÌˆche sich in historischer Zeit veraÌˆndert hat kann aufgrund von verzoÌˆgerten Aussterbe- und Einwanderungsprozessen eine erhoÌˆhte oder verringerte Artenvielfalt vorliegen, die nicht den heutigen Umweltbedingungen entspricht. Es liegen Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungs- bzw. Kolonisierungskredite vor, welcher uÌˆber die Zeit mit Artverlusten oder Zugewinnen von Arten bezahlt werden. Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungskredite und deren Bezahlung sind schwierig zu ermitteln, da einerseits Informationen zu historischen LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen oft fehlen und andererseits auch heutige Umweltfaktoren einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die Artenvielfalt haben. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die heutigen Muster der Artenvielfalt von Waldbodenpflanzen in Laub- und MischwaÌˆldern und deren VeraÌˆnderungen uÌˆber die letzten 60 Jahre zu ermitteln und diese Muster im Hinblick auf historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen zu untersuchen. Das Studiengebiet umfasst groÃŸe Teile der Prignitz (Brandenburg und angrenzende Teile von Sachsen-Anhalt), ein Gebiet, dessen Waldanteil sich in den letzten 100 Jahren kaum veraÌˆndert hat, in dem sich jedoch seit dem Ende des 19ten Jahrhunderts der Anteil historisch alter WaÌˆlder (ohne historische nachgewiesene agrarliche Nutzung) um mehr als 90% reduziert hat, waÌˆhrend an anderer Stelle wenige neue WaÌˆlder auf vorigen AgrarflaÌˆchen etabliert wurden. Im Rahmen dieser Studie wurde zunaÌˆchst die Artenvielfalt und deren aktuelle VeraÌˆnderung in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern untersucht und verglichen. Um den Einfluss von historischen LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen auf die Artenvielfalt zu ermittlen, wurde die historische und heutige Vernetzung der WaldflaÌˆchen analysiert, die Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern verglichen und der Umfang und die Bezahlung der Aussterbeschulden und der Kolonisierungskredite ermittelt. Die Arbeit zeigt, dass historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen die heutige Artenvielfalt noch immer beeinflussen. Obwohl die heutigen Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern vergleichbar waren, war die Gesamtartenzahl in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern signifikant hoÌˆher und in diesen WaÌˆldern wurden insbesondere mehr Waldspezialisten und sich nur uÌˆber kurze Enfernung ausbreitende Pflanzenarten gefunden. Die Unterschiede in den Artenzahlen sind vor allem auf einen Kolonisierungskredit in neu etablierten WaÌˆldern zuruÌˆckzufuÌˆhren, waÌˆhrend die Aussterbeschulden in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern weitgehend bezahlt wurden. Der Kolonisierungskredits war am hoÌˆchsten in isoliert gelegenen WaldflaÌˆchen und belief sich auf bis zu 9 Arten (im Mittel 4,7). Der Kolonisierungskredit in besser vernetzten und in direkt an historisch-alten WaÌˆldern angrenzenden FlaÌˆchen war deutlich geringer. In diesen WaÌˆldern konnte eine Verringerung des Kolonisierungskredites von im Mittel 2,7 zu 1,5 Arten uÌˆber die letzten sechs Jahrzehnte nachgewiesen werden.","Extern ; Institut fÃ¼r Biochemie und Biologie","https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/43939","2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Kolk, Jens (M.

Objectives : In a fragmented landscape in southwest France, we investigated the joint effects of woodland area, structural heterogeneity, connectivity and history on the species richness of forest-specialist hoverflies, and whether there was a time lag in the response of hoverflies to habitat changes, and tested the effect of spatiotemporal changes. Methods : Current species richness was sampled in 48 woodlands using 99 Malaise traps. Structural variables were derived from a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Old maps and aerial photographs were used to extract past and present spatial patterns of the woodlands since 1850. Relationships between species richness and explanatory variables were explored using generalized linear models. Results : We show that current habitat area, connectivity, historical continuity and the average density of tree-microhabitats explained 35 % of variation in species richness. Species richness was affected differently by changes in patch area between 1979 and 2010, depending on woodland connectivity. In isolated woodlands, extinction debt and colonization credit were revealed, showing that even several decades are not sufficient for hoverflies to adapt to landscape-scale habitat conditions. Conclusions : These findings emphasise the importance of maintaining connectedness between woodlands, which facilitates the dispersion in a changing landscape. Our results also highlight the benefits of using a change-oriented approach to explain the current distribution patterns of species, especially when several spatial processes act jointly. ; Peer reviewed","hoverflies ; woodlands ; heterogeneity ; connectivity ; history ; colonization credit ; extinction debt ; [SDV]Life Sciences [q-bio] ; [SHS]Humanities and Social Sciences ; [SDE]Environmental Sciences","https://arbor.bfh.ch/8426/1/Herrault2016_Article_CombinedEffectsOfAreaConnectiv.pdf","2016","HAL CCSD ; Springer Verlag","2016 MAY","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","31","4","877","893","10.1007/s10980-015-0304-3","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000372319700014","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"HERRAULT, Pierre Alexis et al.

Life-history traits and species specialization for target habitat were used to refine the analysis. Target habitat was a complex of wet heathlands, poor fens and bogs. Patches of this complex of habitats were sampled on two high plateaus in the Belgian Ardenne, the Plateau de Saint-Hubert and the Plateau des Tailles. Over the last 250 years, two jointly acting habitat dynamics were observed in these areas: a loss of area (and connectivity) on the one hand but also the creation of new habitat patches. It is precisely this double dynamics that enabled us to analyze and develop concepts linked to the response of species faced with spatio-temporal modifications of their habitat. Specifically, in this work we focused on the comprehension of two unbalanced situations, affecting the relationships between species richness and patch characteristics. A first unbalanced situation, the extinction debt, was observed for vascular plant communities. On the opposite, a colonization credit, the second unbalanced situation, was noted for butterflies and seemed to mainly affect specialist species. Specialist species of the three taxonomic groups showed relatively contrasted responses compared to generalist species. However, the life-history traits we studied only slightly influenced the response of species at the community level, excepted for pioneer communities in habitat patches less than 5 years old.","Restoration ; Colonization credit ; Extinction debt ; Wet heathlands ; Peatland ; Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/17224","2009","ULiÃ¨ge.

But the mechanisms by which, and the scales in time and space at which, populations are dependent on continuity remain debated. We examine the spatial and temporal scales at which occurrences of plants, fungi, and invertebrates are affected by continuity and consider whether they are restricted by time for colonization (continuity per se) or by habitat formation times. We give improved definitions of landscape and local levels of continuity anti evaluate the empirical literature with respect to these. By critically examining the reported effects of continuity on the occurrence of species in forests and woodlands, we explore the mechanisms behind the patterns at local and landscape scales. We conclude that many species are dispersal-limited in the current fragmented landscapes and occur mainly in landscapes with surplus continuity, meaning that the availability of habitats was greater in the past than it is currently. Our review indicates that local continuity per se is important at least for many forest herbs and for certain species of epiphytic lichens, insects, and land snails, but to a lesser extent for fungi. Several studies show that landscape-level continuity affects the current occurrence of species, in particular for vascular plants, but also for particular lichen, bryophyte, and invertebrate species. For continuity-dependent species, a successful conservation strategy should include both extending the period of habitat duration in relict patches and promoting habitat formation in the immediate surroundings of potential source patches. Conservation strategies need to acknowledge the continuity dependence of many species. Research on how to shorten habitat formation times by forest restoration is an urgent priority.","biodiversity ; extinction debt ; land use legacy ; metapopulation dynamics ; species credit","https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/publications/effects-of-ecological-continuity-on-species-richness-and-composition-in-forests-and-woodlands(2ebc8f86-0cfd-431d-b008-bbac6785b9d9).html","2014","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","2014","ECOSCIENCE","21","1","34","45","10.2980/21-1-3667","1195-6860 and 2376-7626","WOS:000348286800004","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","Review","PHILADELPHIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"NordÃ©n, BjÃ¶rn et al.

However, the potential for species credit in landscapes that have experienced a change from decreasing to expanding forest cover has received little attention. Both delayed responses should depend on current landscape forest cover and on species life-history traits, such as longevity, as short-lived species are likely to respond faster than long-lived species. We evaluated the effects of historical and present-day local forest cover on two vertebrate groups with different longevities understorey birds and non-flying small mammals - in forest patches at three Atlantic Forest landscapes. Our work investigated how the probability of extinction debt and species credit varies (i) amongst landscapes with different proportions of forest cover and distinct trajectories of forest cover change, and (ii) between taxa with different life spans. Our results suggest that the existence of extinction debt and species credit, as well as the potential for their future payment and/or receipt, is not only related to forest cover trajectory but also to the amount of remaining forest cover at the landscape scale. Moreover, differences in bird and small mammal life spans seem to be insufficient to affect differently their probability of showing time-delayed responses to landscape change. Synthesis and applications. Our work highlights the need for considering not only the trajectory of deforestation/regeneration but also the amount of forest cover at landscape scale when investigating time-delayed responses to landscape change. As many landscapes are experiencing a change from decreasing to expanding forest cover, understanding the association of extinction and immigration processes, as well as their interactions with the landscape dynamic, is a key factor to plan conservation and restoration actions in human-altered landscapes.","Ecology","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02214.x","2012","Wiley","2012 DEC","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","49","6","1325","1333","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02214.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000311855000014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lira, Paula K. et al.

"JOUR","eng","Closset-Kopp, Deborah and Wasof, Safaa and Decocq, Guillaume","Using process-based indicator species to evaluate ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes","Increasing connectivity among habitat patches is assumed to mitigate the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, leading to the emergence of green and blue infrastructures in public policies as corridors facilitating movements of species within fragmented landscapes. But still, the scientific knowledge and tools for identifying critical features that make a corridor efficient for biodiversity conservation, and for guiding their establishment and management are still scarce. Here, we define three types of indicator species based on their ecological requirements and dispersal traits in the context of forest metacommunities embedded into agricultural landscapes in N France. We then evaluate whether hedgerows can act as corridors for forest herb species and if this can be predicted from the occurrence of the selected indicator species. We show that among each socio-ecological group of forest herb species, (i) the best disperser (""scout"" species) indicates habitat suitability for the other species of the group, hence predicts a colonization credit; (ii) the species with intermediate dispersal traits (""median"" species) indicates forest species richness and composition of a given hedgerow. In contrast, the worst dispersers (""focal"" species) have a low indicator power, as a probable consequence of extinction events occurring in hedgerows, where ecological conditions are suboptimal with respect of forest species. The quality of the corridor increases with the width, height and age of hedgerows, but decreases with increasing land use intensity in adjacent lands. We conclude that process-based indicator species can be valuable tools to assess the efficiency of ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A central topic in nature conservation and ecological restoration is the potential of ecosystems to recover after the reduction of negative anthropogenic impacts. Often, protracted delays in biotic response to abiotic change have been observed.2. We analysed a unique long-term data series in Lake Fure, Denmark, spanning the transformation from pristine environmental conditions in the early 1900s through a period (1920-1970) of eutrophication - from accelerating sewage input of phosphorus (P) - and subsequent re-oligotrophication after sewage cleaning (1970-2015). We examine time delays between P inputs, in-lake P concentrations and the richness and composition of submerged macrophyte communities.3. Lake P concentration exhibited decade-long delays in response to periods of increasing or decreasing P inputs. It took 40 years and a 25-fold increase in P input before P concentrations suddenly took off in the 1960s, reflecting profound sediment accumulation. Following reduced P input from c. 1970, it took 5 years before P concentrations showed the first signs of a decline. In 2014, water P concentration was still markedly higher than in 1931, despite much lower P inputs, because of elevated sediment release.4. Fifty years of eutrophication led to a reduction in aquatic macrophyte richness from 36 species to 12. Species' responses were closely related to their growth strategy and depth distribution. Deep-growing mosses, charophytes and short angiosperms disappeared, while tall angiosperms survived and pollution-tolerant macroalgae colonized and spread. Subsequently, 45 years of oligotrophication led to clearer waters, macrophyte richness recovering to 28 species and some charophytes and short angiosperms reappearing. Dominance of pollution-tolerant macroalgae persisted, however. Change in species dominance takes longer than colonization by new species.5. Synthesis. Time delays of P concentrations, water clarity and macrophyte richness and composition were long and complex. Neglecting growth strategies of species makes application of extinction debt and colonization credit concepts dubious, because numbers of oligotrophic species decrease and eutrophic species increase concomitantly during eutrophication and vice versa during oligotrophication. Although the original high species richness may be attained, it is unlikely that the original species composition is restored because many oligotrophic species have vanished from the regional species pool.","aquatic plant ecology ; colonization credit ; eutrophication ; extinction debt ; historical development ; hysteresis ; nutrients ; oligotrophication","https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/decadelong-time-delays-in-nutrient-and-plant-species-dynamics-during-eutrophication-and-reoligotrophication-of-lake-fure-19002015(d540297a-86b3-4f86-b356-0401883a177e).html","2017","WILEY","2017 MAY","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","105","3","690","700","10.1111/1365-2745.12715","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000400594500013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Sand-Jensen, Kaj et al.

Au sein des lisiÃ¨res d'habitats rÃ©cents, une interaction entre effet lisiÃ¨re et effet histoire peut Ã©galement Ãªtre rencontrÃ©e. Dans cette thÃ¨se, les objectifs ont Ã©tÃ© d'Ã©valuer l'influence relative de l'effet lisiÃ¨re et de l'effet histoire le long d'interfaces forÃªt-prairie stables, issues d'afforestation et issues de dÃ©forestation en s'intÃ©ressant (i) aux conditions environnementales, (ii) Ã  la richesse et Ã  la composition floristique des communautÃ©s vÃ©gÃ©tales, et (iii) aux valeurs de traits au sein des communautÃ©s.

Bird community characteristics and population trends in secondary forests are infrequently studied, but secondary forest may serve as a â€œsafety netâ€ for tropical biodiversity. Less understood is the occurrence of time-delayed, community-level dynamics such as an extinction debt of specialist species or a species credit resulting from the recolonization of forest patches by extirpated species. We sought to elucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities in secondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year period during the late breeding season and mid-winter. We classified birds caught in mist nets or recorded in point counts by residency status, and further grouped them based on preferred habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, conservation priority, foraging guild, and foraging strata. Using hierarchical, mixed-effects models we tested for trends among species that share traits. We found that permanent-resident species increased over time relative to migrants. In both seasons, primary forest species generally increased while species typical of secondary forest, scrub, or edge declined. Species relatively sensitive to habitat disturbance increased significantly over time, whereas birds less sensitive to disturbance decreased. Similarly, generalists with higher habitat breadth scores declined. Because, we found very few changes in vegetation characteristics in secondary forest patches, shifts in the avian community toward primary forest species represent a species credit and are likely related to vegetation changes in the broader landscape. We suggest that natural regeneration and maturation of secondary forests should be recognized as a positive conservation development of potential benefit even to species typical of primary forest.","Avian abundance ; Habitat change ; Land use ; Neotropical migratory birds ; Tropical countryside ; Medicine ; R","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494173/","2017","PeerJ Inc.","2017 JUN 30","PEERJ","5",NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.3539","2167-8359","WOS:000405264100008","341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Latta, Steven C. et al.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how current woody plant species distribution, composition and richness related to historical and present land uses. Location: A smallholder farming landscape in south-western Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1-ha sites in farmland and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted vs. permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognized conservation values, although apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in south-western Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaicâ€”similar to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.","agricultural mosaic ; biodiversity conservation ; extinction debt ; immigration credit ; novel ecosystems ; nurse tree effect ; /dk/atira/pure/core/keywords/nachhaltigkeitswissenschaft ; Sustainability Science","http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/land-use-legacy-effects-on-woody-vegetation-in-agricultural-landscapes-of-southwestern-ethiopia(33e0aa60-b9e4-45e6-a9ec-9b8cb6ce5291).html","2018","WILEY","2018 AUG","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","24","8","1136","1148","10.1111/ddi.12754","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000438200700009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Shumi, Girma et al.

With a combination of vegetation and remotely-sensed time series data, we quantitatively identify the responses of land- cover types and their associated vegetation between 1987 and 2016. Fuzzy clustering of 11 Landsat images was used to identify main land-cover types. Vegetation belts corresponding to such land- cover types were identified by using species indicator analysis performed on 80 vegetation plots. A post-classification evaluation of trends, magnitude, and elevational shifts was done using fuzzy membership values as a proxy of the occupied surfaces by land-cover types. Our findings show that forests and scrublands expanded upward as much as the glacier retreated, i.e., by 24% and 23% since 1987, respectively. While lower alpine grassland shifted upward, the upper alpine grassland lost 10% of its originally occupied surface showing no elevational shift. Moreover, an increase of suitable sites for the expansion of the subnival vegetation belt has been observed, due to the increasing availability of new ice-free areas. The consistent findings suggest a general expansion of forest and scrubland to the detriment of alpine grasslands, which in turn are shifting upwards or declining in area. In conclusion, alpine grasslands need urgent and appropriate monitoring processes ranging from the species to the landscape level that integrates remotely-sensed and field data.","colonization credit ; extinction debt ; fuzzy clustering ; global change ; high-mountain environment ; land-cover ; thermophilization","http://hdl.handle.net/11585/786731","2021","MDPI AG","2021 JAN","REMOTE SENSING","13","1",NA,NA,"10.3390/rs13010134","2072-4292","WOS:000606123600001","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Article","BASEL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Alessi, Nicola et al.

Given their spatial configuration, alpine areas have been traditionally seen as islands surrounded by an â€œoceanâ€ of unsuitable lands. A quantitative assessment of the effects of Holocene climate fluctuations on islands area and interâ€island connectivity is crucial to finely reconstruct past biodiversity dynamics and forecast species responses to future changes. Location Italy. Taxa Carabidae (Ground beetles), Chrysomelidae (Leaf beetles), Elateridae (Click beetles), Orthoptera (Grasshoppers and Crickets) and Papilionoidea (Butterflies and Skippers). Methods A total of 1,077 species for 128,093 records were analysed and a classification based on their functional traits allowed identifying groups of good and poor dispersers within each taxon. A dynamic discrete model of ecosystem evolution provided the spatioâ€temporal context to test two competing (transient equilibria vs. nonequilibrium) dynamics based on different colonization capabilities. In the transient equilibria dynamic the species are able to respond to island evolution through successful dispersal and colonization events, whereas in the nonequilibrium dynamic ineffective immigration constrains the current species richness to that generated by the strongest island contraction. Results With the exception of Elateridae, good dispersers (Chrysomelidae and Papilionoidea) responded to environmental changes by establishing a series of transient equilibria. In contrast, the nonequilibrium dynamic better described patterns of species richness in poor dispersers (Carabidae and Orthoptera). Main conclusions Our approach could be used as the basis for the development of spatially and temporally explicit models of island evolution and could be a valuable tool for quantifying the sensitivity of single taxa to climateâ€driven habitat changes. It also represents a further step towards the forecasting of future responses to climate change and the accompanying development of conservation strategies that more effectively respond to the detrimental impacts of climate change on biodiversity.","Alpine ecosystems ; Alpine species ; extinction debt ; holocene ; immigration credit ; island biogeography ; island evolution ; nonequilibrium dynamics ; transient equilibria ; Settore BIO/05","http://hdl.handle.net/2108/216483","2019","WILEY","2019 OCT","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY","46","10","2248","2259","10.6084/m9.figshare.8204816.v1","0305-0270 and 1365-2699","DRCI:DATA2019173016907266","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Data set","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Marta, Silvio et al.

B. and Siqueira, Tadeu","Interactive persistent effects of past land-cover and its trajectory on tropical freshwater biodiversity","Evidence indicating that ecological communities show delayed responses to environmental change has raised the need to better understand the effects of landscape history on biodiversity. We investigated how freshwater biodiversity is related to both recent and past land use change in tropical river catchments. More specifically, we analysed the relationship between biodiversity and change in forest cover that occurred across five decades, including landscape trajectories of forest gain and loss. The abundance of stream insects showed a more delayed response to landscape change than rarefied richness, whereas the Tsallis diversity index was not related to past forest cover. However, both alpha diversity and local abundance were related to mean forest cover across the five decades when conditioned by the trajectory of change. We found a negative relationship between the historical mean of forest cover and community descriptors in streams embedded in landscapes on a trajectory of forest loss, but a positive relationship in landscapes on a trajectory of forest gain. We provide the first evidence of delayed responses of tropical freshwater insect communities to landscape history and suggest that the magnitude of change in forest cover, mediated by its trajectory, is a major driver of delayed responses. We show that a trajectory of forest loss might result in both immediate loss of species and a set of species doomed for future extinction. Synthesis and applications. Delayed responses of multispecies communities to past landscape changes depend on their extent, frequency and intensity. Our findings indicate that, beyond the relative amount of forest cover within river catchments, the magnitude of change in forest cover mediated by its historical trajectory can be a major driver of delayed responses in stream communities. We suggest that, if biodiversity conservation is the main aim, stream restoration should be prioritized in catchments with higher forest cover, as even under a forest gain trajectory, stream communities continue responding to past landscape changes depending on how widespread and intensive changes were.","aquatic biodiversity ; deforestation ; extinction debt ; forest recovery ; freshwater ecosystems ; immigration credit ; landscape history ; tropical streams","http://hdl.handle.net/11449/199186","2020","WILEY","2020 NOV","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","57","11","2149","2158","10.1111/1365-2664.13717","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000554431200001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Santos, Edineusa P. et al.

Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5â€“10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration. ; published version ; peerReviewed","anthropogenic disturbance ; community composition ; extinction debt ; immigration credit ; mire ; recovery ; debt ; resilience ; trajectory ; vegetation","https://erepo.uef.fi/handle/123456789/4342","2017","Wiley-Blackwell ; Yhdysvallat (USA)","2017 OCT","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","7","19","7848","7858","10.1002/ece3.3243","2045-7758","WOS:000412523700025","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Haapalehto, Tuomas et al.

"JOUR","Anglais","Lalechere, Etienne and Jabot, Franck and Archaux, Frederic and Deffuant, Guillaume","Projected regional forest plant community dynamics evidence centuries-long effects of habitat turnover","Questions Many Western European and North American countries have been experiencing strong reforestation in the last two centuries due to agricultural abandonment. Other landâ€use changes, such as urbanization, can simultaneously trigger forest erosion. In this context of habitat turnover, forest understorey plant dynamics depend on the balance between immigration credit in postâ€agricultural forest and extinction debt in ancient forest. The transient and final community properties following concomitant habitat creation and destruction are poorly known. In this contribution, we study the projected transient regional forest plant dynamics and identify the determinants of the relaxation duration at both landscape and patch scales. Location Seineâ€etâ€Marne region, France. Methods Species' incidences are projected in 9,208 patches of the Seineâ€etâ€Marne region characterized by strong development of postâ€agricultural forests and a moderate erosion of ancient forests during the period 1840-2000. We use a metapopulation model with static biodiversity data and landscape history to project forest plant dynamics. We focus on 33 generalist forest species that are able to colonize both ancient and postâ€agricultural forests. Results Our analyses reveal that (1) extinction in ancient forests slows the colonization process, which lasts between 250 and 990 years after habitat turnover, depending on species characteristics; (2) the species incidence in postâ€agricultural forests converges towards that in ancient forests long before the overall species incidence stabilizes at the landscape scale (i.e. long before the relaxation time); (3) landscapeâ€ and patchâ€scale relaxation times depend on species colonization ability and patch functional connectivity; (4) the colonization process is rather slow for ancient forest species; and (5) the incidence of ancient forest species becomes larger than the incidence of other species at the end of the colonization dynamics thanks to their strong persistence. Conclusions Ancient forest species may potentially benefit from a large immigration credit but need centuries to use it.

Other landâ€use changes, such as urbanization, can simultaneously trigger forest erosion. In this context of habitat turnover, forest understorey plant dynamics depend on the balance between immigration credit in postâ€agricultural forest and extinction debt in ancient forest. The transient and final community properties following concomitant habitat creation and destruction are poorly known. In this contribution, we study the projected transient regional forest plant dynamics and identify the determinants of the relaxation duration at both landscape and patch scales. Location Seineâ€etâ€Marne region, France. Methods Species' incidences are projected in 9,208 patches of the Seineâ€etâ€Marne region characterized by strong development of postâ€agricultural forests and a moderate erosion of ancient forests during the period 1840-2000. We use a metapopulation model with static biodiversity data and landscape history to project forest plant dynamics. We focus on 33 generalist forest species that are able to colonize both ancient and postâ€agricultural forests. Results Our analyses reveal that (1) extinction in ancient forests slows the colonization process, which lasts between 250 and 990 years after habitat turnover, depending on species characteristics; (2) the species incidence in postâ€agricultural forests converges towards that in ancient forests long before the overall species incidence stabilizes at the landscape scale (i.e. long before the relaxation time); (3) landscapeâ€ and patchâ€scale relaxation times depend on species colonization ability and patch functional connectivity; (4) the colonization process is rather slow for ancient forest species; and (5) the incidence of ancient forest species becomes larger than the incidence of other species at the end of the colonization dynamics thanks to their strong persistence. Conclusions Ancient forest species may potentially benefit from a large immigration credit but need centuries to use it. On such time scales, many perturbations are likely to jeopardize the realization of this potential credit.","LAND-USE HISTORY LEGACY ; LONG-TERM CHANGE ; RELAXATION TIMES ; TIME LAGS ; DELAYED DYNAMICS ; LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS ; METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS ; METAPOPULATION MODELS ; EXTINCTION ; [SDE]Environmental Sciences","https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-02608107","2018","HAL CCSD ; Wiley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"LalechÃ¨re, Etienne et al.

"THES","nl","THES","Dynamiek van boomgemeenschappen en het functioneren van een ecosysteem in een tropisch landschap met ontbossingsproblematiek ; Tree community dynamics and ecosystem function in a tropical landscape under deforestation pressure","The human population growth in many parts of the world causes a rising demand for resources. This often induces deforestation, resulting in small forest relicts embedded in a human-modified landscape consisting of agricultural fields, exotic tree plantations, and settlements. The Taita Hills (Kenya), which was the study area for this doctoral research, is a prime example of these processes. The tree species composition and structure was inventoried in the twelve remaining forest relicts, the exotic plantations, and the matrix. With these data we quantified the remaining biodiversity, the related ecosystem services, and the potential for restoration actions. First, the indigenous forest relicts were studied. Four forest communities were defined, including two (i.e. Millettia-Craibia and Chrysophyllum-Strombosia) with typically late successional tree species and two (i.e. Phoenix-Maesa and Tabernaemontana), which consisted mainly of early-successional species. We suggest that the species composition of the larger forest relicts, where all four communities were found, resembles the historical or natural state. The occurrence of the Phoenix-Maesa or Tabernamontana community was restricted to forest edges and the smaller forest relicts. These relicts can be defined as hybrid ecosystems due to the absence of late successional species. Such hybrid ecosystems differ from the historical species composition, but still hold the potential to be restored with adapted management measures. We found the larger forest relicts, on higher altitudes, further away from the forest edges and on sites with low human disturbance to be significantly more biodiverse. In these forest relicts, we also analysed the reproductive success of the tree species. The forest regeneration determines future forest structure and composition, but is often severely hampered in degraded forests. The extinction debt, recruitment, and colonization credit was quantified for each forest relict and on landscape level based on the co-occurrence of tree species in the seedling, sapling or mature tree layer. On landscape level, the potential extinction debt was 9% of the regional species pool. This corresponds with seven species likely to become extinct in the Taita Hills. On the scale of a forest relict, several species were absent in the upper canopy layer while they did occur in the regeneration layer. This recruitment credit was three and six species for the large and small forest relicts, respectively, while the potential extinction debt was twelve and four species respectively. Circa 20% of all tree species in a forest relict were threatened by extinction. The conservation value of the smaller forest relicts was higher than expected because of the relatively high recruitment credit, which even included late-successional species. In the second part, the role of exotic tree plantations for biodiversity conservation was studied. Therefore, the regeneration of indigenous and exotic species was measured in plantations dominated by Pinus patula, Eucalyptus saligna, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea robusta or Acacia mearnsii. Regeneration of indigenous species, even late-successional species, was relatively higher in Grevillea plantations. The other plantation types had a significantly lower performance, partly due to the invasive character of the dominant species. In the third part, solitary trees were studied in the human-modified landscape. In total, 65 tree species were observed (63% of these were indigenous). A non-random distribution of tree traits was observed in the landscape. For instance, more exotic tree species occurred on croplands where they may deliver marketable products or services, play a role in nitrogen fixation or can be used in agroforestry systems. The indigenous species also delivered multiple products or ecosystem services, but no other services than exotic species. The matrix clearly functions as a refuge for a subset of the indigenous tree species and becomes a place for domestication and preservation of useful species. Future changes in key social and ecological drivers are expected and ecosystem service trade-offs may arise. For instance, the loss of local knowledge on indigenous plant species can result in a replacement of indigenous species by exotics. Faced with the challenges of demography and poverty, the area of cultivated land is increasing worldwide and the production of goods and services is intensified and enhanced. Within intensified systems, indigenous tree species are at risk due to several, non-exclusive reasons. Especially the conservation of late-successional tree species in these landscapes is precarious, because they are restricted to the forest interior of large forest relicts. In contrast, early-successional species seem to persist throughout the landscape. These pioneer trees can catalyse all production processes, both cultivated and natural, while they also diminish the pressure on the remaining forest relicts. The protection of the remaining indigenous forest relicts, combined with the enlargement of secondary forest, for instance by conversion of exotic plantations, and the protection of the solitary trees in the matrix is necessary for the protection of the regional biodiversity and the ecosystem services they deliver. nheemse bosrelicten, boomplantages en de landbouwmatrix.

Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. 2. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (ca. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities extinction debt. 3. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. 4. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. 5. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlights areas where such conservation activities should be implemented.

These habitats nowadays benefit from large-scale restoration projects, for which the success should be evaluated.Recently, the concept of colonisation credit (the number of species yet to colonise a patch) was proposed as a spatially explicit framework to assess recovery in species richness following restoration. In this study, we estimated the colonisation credit of wet heathland butterfly communities in Southern Belgium. The method was applied separately to generalist and specialist species for two reference dates (new patches < 25 years old and new patches 25-55 years old).Only a marginally significant colonisation credit was detected for generalist species. In contrast, we found a significant colonisation credit for specialists, although this was due to a very limited number of strict specialist species. Butterfly community composition differed only marginally between patch age classes.As a general trend, butterfly communities exhibit a rapid response (< 25 years) to landscape structure modification. However, conservation and restoration actions should urgently target strict specialists, exhibiting colonisation limitation in new habitat patches. A lack of colonisation credit for plant communities in the same landscape suggests that restoration of wet heathlands may be successful in the short term for various taxonomic groups.","Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/67404","2010","WILEY","2010 MAY","INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY","3","2","83","91","10.1111/j.1752-4598.2009.00075.x","1752-458X and 1752-4598","WOS:000276404300003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cristofoli, Sara et al.

Plant species may exhibit a slow response to fragmentation, resulting in the development of an extinction debt in fragmented plant communities. The detection of extinction debt is of primary importance in habitat conservation strategies. We applied two different approaches proposed in the literature to identify extinction debt in South-East Belgium calcareous grasslands. The first method compared species richness between stable and fragmented habitat patches. The second explored correlations between current species richness and current and past landscape configurations using multiple regression analyses. We subsequently examined results generated by both methods. In addition, we proposed techniques to identify species that are more likely to support extinction debt and associated functional traits. We estimated a respective extinction debt of approximately 28% and 35% of the total and specialist species richness. Similar results were obtained from both methods. We identified 15 threatened specialist species under the current landscape configuration. It is likely the landscape configuration no longer supports the species habitat requirements. We demonstrated that non-clonal species are most threatened, as well as taxa that cannot persist in degraded habitats and form only sparsely distributed populations. We discussed our results in light of other studies in similar habitats, and the overall implications for habitat conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"CONF","en","Dupouey, Jean-Luc","Forest ecological history for the future","International audience ; Historical, archaeological and paleoecological data provide a better understanding of the current distribution of species, which cannot be inferred directly from the sole knowledge of their fundamental ecological niche, dispersal ability and interactions with other species. The long time is an additional component, which is the object of historical ecology, the branch of ecology that is interested in legacies of the past in the current functioning of ecosystems. We will present some examples of the significance of these long-term effects.The first concerns the impact of past land-use changes on vegetation. Europe has known for the last two centuries a significant increase in forest area. We show the multiple impacts on the composition of plant communities of this forest expansion, in the Mediterranean area among others. This has led to the development of the important concept of ancient and recent forests, which is now classically included in assessments of the degree of naturalness of forests. We have tried to characterize the duration of these impacts: following the recolonization of a former agricultural soil, how long time does it take to erase the extinction debt of the species previously present but destined to disappear, and the colonization credit of the species that still have to arrive? The research that we have conducted on several Roman sites shows that these impacts have a multi-millennial span. We analyze the mechanisms of this strikingly long memory of ecosystems.In a second example, we will search for anthropogenic traces in the current spatial range of Fagus sylvatica in France. The resampling of dendrometric inventories from the XVIIIth century, the distribution of toponyms of beech at the national scale and soil charcoal analyses show how this tree species has been disadvantaged by forest management, perhaps early in the Neolithic period. Knowledge of such large-scale manipulations is needed to properly characterize the beech climatic niche, in order to be able to project its future distribution range into different climate change scenarios.The reaction times of plant communities to natural or anthropogenic disturbances can be very long, as shown by the examples presented. This has many consequences: climacic equilibria are rarely or never reached, the impacts of human actions should be appreciated over much longer time horizons than they are today, the understanding of our biotic environment cannot be done without an historical perspective. Time must be considered as a relevant attribute of the species niche.","[SDV.EE.ECO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology ; environment/Ecosystems ; [SDV.SA.SF]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Agricultural sciences/Silviculture ; forestry ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology ; [SDE.MCG]Environmental Sciences/Global Changes ; [SHS.ENVIR]Humanities and Social Sciences/Environmental studies","https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-03084784","2019","HAL CCSD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Dupouey, Jean-Luc (2019) Forest Ecological History for the Future. <i>Conf</i>.

Are there specific species at the edge and/or specialist species transgressions between adjacent habitats? How does edge displacement following land-use change alter distance-to-edge plant diversity patterns? What are the relative influences of the edge effect and the edge displacement in forests and grasslands? Location: Forests and grasslands in northeast France. Methods : Floristic surveys were conducted in three types of forest-grassland interface, which can be stable or the result of edge displacements due to afforestation or deforestation. The sample comprised a total of 132 plots in 22 forest-grassland interfaces. Point-biserial correlation coefficients were used to classify the species into several groups in stable interfaces: forest, edge or grassland specialists and generalists. Using LMMs and Tukey's HSD tests, the total species richness and that of each species group were compared between the plot positions (i.e. distance-to-edge) and between the stable interfaces and cases of afforestation and deforestation. To evaluate the relative influence of the edge effect (plot position) and edge displacement (afforestation/deforestation) on plant community composition, CCAs and variation partitionings were performed. Results : The largest difference in both plant community richness and composition was found between the forest and grassland edges. The highest species richness was found at the grassland edges. In addition to a high number of generalist species, a mixture of forest and grassland specialist species were predominant at the edges, and the forest specialists were almost the only transgressive species. Afforestation interfaces showed an extinction debt of grassland and edge specialist species and a colonization credit of forest specialists in recent forests. The effects of edge displacement were larger than those of the edge effect in forests, and the opposite was observed in the grasslands. Conclusions : Forest and grassland plant communities differ strongly even over very short distances. However, the edges host a large number of forest and grassland specialist species, which explain higher species richness than in adjacent habitats. This results from interactive effects of distance-to-edge and edge displacement following land-use change.","SPATIAL-PATTERNS; HABITAT EDGES; LANDSCAPE; CONSERVATION; MECHANISMS; BOUNDARIES; INVASION; ECOTONES; ANCIENT ; nord est de la France ; interface forÃªt ; prairie ; changement d'affectation des sols ; plante forestiÃ¨re ; communautÃ© vÃ©gÃ©tale ; rÃ©partition des espÃ¨ces","http://prodinra.inra.fr/ft/EDB2EE96-313E-464F-9055-6E23501A017E","2017","WILEY","2017 MAY","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","28","3","515","526","10.1111/jvs.12501","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000400937500008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Burst, Maxime et al.

A case study of antagonistic butterfly larvaeâ€“plant networks","Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species richness in fragmented habitats and can lead to immediate or time-delayed species extinctions. Asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt between interacting species may have severe effects on ecological networks. However, these effects remain largely unknown. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch and landscape changes on antagonistic butterfly larvae-plant trophic networks in Mediterranean grasslands in which previous studies had shown the existence of extinction debt in plants but not in butterflies. We sampled current species richness of habitat-specialist and generalist butterflies and vascular plants in 26 grasslands. We assessed the direct effects of historical and current patch and landscape characteristics on species richness and on butterfly larvae-plant trophic network metrics and robustness. Although positive species- and interactions-area relationships were found in all networks, structure and robustness was only affected by patch and landscape changes in networks involving the subset of butterfly specialists. Larger patches had more species (butterflies and host plants) and interactions but also more compartments, which decreased network connectance but increased network stability. Moreover, most likely due to the rescue effect, patch connectivity increased host-plant species (but not butterfly) richness and total links, and network robustness in specialist networks. On the other hand, patch area loss decreased robustness in specialist butterfly larvae-plant networks and made them more prone to collapse against host plant extinctions. Finally, in all butterfly larvae-plant networks we also detected a past patch and landscape effect on network asymmetry, which indicates that there were different extinction rates and extinction debts for butterflies and host plants. We conclude that asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt in butterfly-plant networks provoked by patch and landscape changes caused changes in species richness and network links in all networks, as well as changes in network structure and robustness in specialist networks.

"JOUR",NA,"Hylander, Kristoffer and Nemomissa, Sileshi","Data from: Waiving the extinction debt: can shade from coffee prevent extinctions of epiphytic plants from isolated trees?","Aim: Local extinction after habitat modifications is often delayed, leading to an extinction debt. Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate. Location: Bonga, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia. Methods: We studied 50 trees that had been isolated for periods ranging from a few years to half a century after clearing. The trees were now located in the agricultural landscape at different distances from intact Afromontane forests. Fourteen trees in the forests were used as references. Each tree was inventoried for all vascular epiphytic plants, mosses and liverworts. Results: Time since clearance had a direct negative effect on number of forest specialist species via delayed extinctions and the detected large extinction debt of both bryophytes and vascular plants continued to be paid over several decades. However, time since clearance had an indirect positive effect on number of forest indicator species via the reappearance of shade from coffee planted surrounding the trees, even if the waiving effect on the extinction debt was rather small. Additionally, trees at further distances from the forest edge had fewer forest-associated species. Main conclusions: Our results show that the ability of agroecological landscapes to foster forest biodiversity may be overestimated if meta-community processes over time and space are not taken into account. However, the possibility of initiating counteracting processes that modify the level of expected local extinctions should be evaluated more often to find ways of improving conditions for biodiversity in human-modified landscapes.

No entanto, o histÃ³rico de alteraÃ§Ãµes da paisagem Ã© um dos fatores que, ao ser ignorado, pode levar a interpretaÃ§Ã£o errada dos reais efeitos da perda e fragmentaÃ§Ã£o florestal sobre a diversidade de espÃ©cies. Assim, o objetivo desta tese foi avaliar os efeitos do histÃ³rico de mudanÃ§a da paisagem sobre aves e pequenos mamÃ­feros na Mata AtlÃ¢ntica. Para atingir este objetivo eu investiguei (1) a dinÃ¢mica de trÃªs paisagens fragmentadas de Mata AtlÃ¢ntica entre 1960-1980 e 1980-2000, (2) os efeitos da cobertura florestal passada e atual sobre a riqueza de espÃ©cies de espÃ©cies e, (3) a plausibilidade de modelos de cobertura vegetal nativa na riqueza de espÃ©cies e abundÃ¢ncia, considerando ou nÃ£o a heterogeneidade da vegetaÃ§Ã£o nativa. Para investigar essas questÃµes, foram usados dados de aves e pequenos mamÃ­feros em 53 fragmentos florestais localizados em trÃªs paisagens com diferentes proporÃ§Ãµes de cobertura florestal (10, 30 e 50%) na Mata AtlÃ¢ntica do Planalto AtlÃ¢ntico de SÃ£o Paulo. Os resultados mostraram que (1) a trajetÃ³ria da cobertura florestal entre os anos 1960 e 2000 nas trÃªs paisagens estudadas foi nÃ£o-linear e, atualmente, fragmentos florestais consistem de um mosaico de florestas com diferentes idades de regeneraÃ§Ã£o, (2) a existÃªncia do dÃ©bito de extinÃ§Ã£o e do crÃ©dito de espÃ©cies, assim como o potencial para o seu pagamento futuro, depende nÃ£o sÃ³ da trajetÃ³ria de cobertura florestal, mas tambÃ©m da cobertura florestal remanescente na escala da paisagem, e (3) a heterogeneidade da vegetaÃ§Ã£o nativa desempenha um papel importante na definiÃ§Ã£o da riqueza de espÃ©cies e abundÃ¢ncia e que as respostas a essa heterogeneidade sÃ£o definidas pelos requerimentos de habitat e dependem de cobertura florestal da paisagem. ; Despite the extended literature on the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on biodiversity, few studies incorporated the temporal aspect, i.e. the history of change of habitat amount and configuration over time at a given landscape, in the analysis. However, ignoring landscape change history might lead to inaccurate interpretation of the impact of forest loss and fragmentation on species diversity. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of landscape change history on birds and small mammals in the Atlantic Forest. To achieve this aim I investigated (1) the land-use and land-cover change dynamics in Atlantic Forest fragmented landscapes between 1960s-1980s and 1980s-2000s, (2) the effects of historical and present-day forest cover on species richness and, (3) the potential of explaining species richness and abundance patterns by inclusion or exclusion of present native vegetation heterogeneity in model frameworks. To address these objectives I used data on birds and small mammals in 53 forest fragments from three landscapes with different proportions of forest cover (10, 30 and 50%) in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The results showed that (1) forest cover trajectory between the 1960s and 2000s at the three study landscapes was non-linear and that individual forest patches currently consist of a mosaic of different forest age classes, (2) the existence of extinction debt and species credit as well as the potential for their future payment depends not only on forest cover trajectory but also on the present amount of remaining forest cover at the landscape scale, and (3) the heterogeneity within native vegetation plays an important role in defining species richness and abundance in fragmented landscapes and responses to this heterogeneity are defined by habitat requirements and depend on forest cover at landscape scale.","CrÃ©dito de espÃ©cies ; DÃ©bito de extinÃ§Ã£o ; DinÃ¢mica da paisagem ; Extinction debt ; Forest age ; Idade da floresta ; Landscape dynamics ; Species credit","http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/41/41134/tde-18012012-084010/","2011","Biblioteca Digitais de Teses e DissertaÃ§Ãµes da USP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Lira, Paula Koeler (2011) Efeitos Do Histã³rico De Alteraã§ãµes Da Paisagem Sobre Aves e Pequenos Mamã­feros Na Mata Atlã¢ntica ; Effects of Landscape Change History on Birds and Small Mammals in the Atlantic Forest. <i>Thes</i>.

The destruction and creation of habitats can induce a debt of extinction or an immigration credit, i.e. species dynamics that are not immediate but delayed in time in relation to this habitat rotation. The presence of a time delay means that the species are not in equilibrium with the current landscapes. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the contribution of out-of-equilibrium metapopulation models to understand these time-shifted dynamics theoretically and based on empirical data on forest plants. To this end, we evaluated the robustness of a method for inferring out-of-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics parameters, adapted to the regional scale. It was then applied to contemporary data on forest plants and time series of forest maps in the departments of Seine-et-Marne and Eure-et-Loir. From the models used, we were able to reproduce some characteristics of the distribution of species that are due to the historical evolution of forest areas. Indeed, some species are more frequent in old-growth forests and others in recent forests, which is partly explained by the characteristics of the species and their affinity for specific environmental conditions. From long-term projections of their dynamics, we have shown that the response times of these species can be several centuries and are highly dependent on the functional connectivity of habitats. Virtual habitat rotation scenarios were simulated to compensate for the analysis of the study areas alone. Associated with projections of metapopulation dynamics, which make it possible to control the parameters to be studied, we tested the relative importance of the dispersion distance of species and the spatial configuration of habitat rotation on these dynamics. The time to return to metapopulation equilibrium is not only explained by the magnitude of the extinction debt or immigration credit, but also depends on these two factors. These results highlight the importance of deepening our knowledge of the effects of successive disturbances that make the theoretical return to species equilibrium highly uncertain. / Les modÃ¨les de mÃ©tapopulations permettent de prÃ©dire l'occupation des habitats au sein desquels elles Ã©voluent en fonction de la configuration spatiale du paysage.

A ces fins, nous avons Ã©valuÃ© la robustesse d'une mÃ©thode d'infÃ©rence de paramÃ¨tres de dynamique de mÃ©tapopulations hors Ã©quilibre, adaptÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©chelle rÃ©gionale. Elle a ensuite Ã©tÃ© appliquÃ©e sur des donnÃ©es contemporaines de plantes forestiÃ¨res et de sÃ©ries temporelles de cartographies des forÃªts dans les dÃ©partements de la Seine-et-Marne et de l'Eure-et-Loir. A partir des modÃ¨les utilisÃ©s, nous avons pu reproduire certaines caractÃ©ristiques de la rÃ©partition des espÃ¨ces qui sont dues Ã  l'Ã©volution historique des surfaces forestiÃ¨res. En effet, certaines espÃ¨ces sont plus frÃ©quentes en forÃªt anciennes et d'autres en forÃªt rÃ©centes, ce qui s'explique en partie par les traits des espÃ¨ces et leurs affinitÃ©s pour des conditions environnementales spÃ©cifiques. A partir de projections Ã  long-terme de leurs dynamiques, nous avons montrÃ© que les dÃ©lais de rÃ©ponse de ces espÃ¨ces peuvent Ãªtre de plusieurs siÃ¨cles et dÃ©pendent fortement de la connectivitÃ© fonctionnelle des habitats.

Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas where such conservation activities should be implemented. ; Fil: Semper Pascual, AsunciÃ³n. UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin; Alemania ; Fil: Macchi, Leandro.

The model encapsulates previous approaches based on diversity-dependent (DD) extinction rates while allowing for a more flexible treatment of temporal dynamics. Three important results emerge. First, species loss rate slows down with the age of the isolate, a strong and general pattern largely unnoticed so far. Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms. Thirdly, a simple diversity-independent model based on area (converted into population size) and age explains 97% of the variability in species loss rate and appears to be a promising predictive tool to handle extinction debt following habitat loss.","Amphibians ; birds ; conservation biology ; diversity dependence ; habitat fragmentation ; insular biogeography ; mammals ; relaxation ; reptiles","http://www.documentation.ird.fr/hor/fdi:010069501","2017","WILEY","2017 MAY","ECOLOGY LETTERS","20","5","591","598","10.1111/ele.12756","1461-023X and 1461-0248","WOS:000399361500003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hugueny, Bernard (2017) Age-Area Scaling of Extinction Debt Within Isolated Terrestrial Vertebrate Assemblages. <i>Jour</i>.

"JOUR","en","Piessens, Katrien and Hermy, Martin","Does the heathland flora of north-western Belgium show an extinction debt?","The large losses of heathland area since the end of the 18th century can be expected to have resulted in the decline or even extinction of many characteristic heathland species. Historical data on plant species distribution patterns can provide valuable information in this context. Therefore, the aims of this research are to study how the loss of heathland area has changed the presence of heathland and forest plant species in north-western Belgium using historical plant distribution data, and to test whether the heathland flora shows an extinction debt. Furthermore, plant traits determining extinction sensitivity are investigated.Our results revealed that, despite the dramatic reduction of heathland area (more than 99% of heathland was destroyed over a 230-year period), the loss of heathland species is relatively limited (11%) and is comparable with that of forest species (11%). Heathland species that have a long-term persistent seed bank or can propagate vegetatively are least sensitive to extinction. For forest species, on the other hand, growth form is the key determinant for extinction sensitivity. Long-lived woody species have a greater chance of persisting.The relatively low extinction numbers probably represent an extinction debt and the full effects of habitat loss may not have been fully manifested yet. Consequently, future extinctions are expected to occur unless environmental conditions are improved. Therefore, heathland restoration and prevention of further heathland area losses is required.

"JOUR","en","Chen, Ling-ling and Hui, Cang","Habitat destruction and the extinction debt revisited: The Allee effect","Habitat destruction. often caused by anthropogenic disturbance, can lead to the extinction of species at an unprecedented rate. It is important, therefore, to consider habitat destruction when assessing population viability. Another factor often ignored in population viability analysis, is the Allee effect that adds to the risk of populations already on the verge of extinction. Understanding the Allee effect on species dynamics and response to habitat destruction has intrinsic value in conservation prioritization. Here, the Allee effect was considered in a multi-species hierarchical competition model. Results showed that species persistence declines dramatically due to the Allee effect, and certain species become more susceptible to habitat destruction than others. Two extinction orders emerged under habitat destruction: either the best competitor becomes extinct first or the best colonizer first. The extinction debt and order, as well as the time lag between habitat destruction and species extinction, were found to be determined by species abundance and the intensity of the Allee effect.

We solve this model using a real-options approach, which leads to the conventional conversion rule as a special case.

Habitat loss leading to smaller patch sizes and decreasing connectivity is a major threat to global biodiversity. While some species vanish immediately after a change in habitat conditions, others show delayed extinction, that is, an extinction debt. In case of an extinction debt, the current species richness is higher than expected under present habitat conditions. 2. We investigated wetlands of the canton of ZÃ¼rich in the lowlands of Eastern Switzerland where a wetland loss of 90% over the last 150 years occurred. We related current species richness to current and past patch area and connectivity (in 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000). We compared current with predicted species richness in wetlands with a substantial loss in patch area based on the speciesâ€area relationship of wetlands without substantial loss in patch area and studied relationships between the richness of different species groups and current and historical area and connectivity of wetland patches. 3. We found evidence of a possible extinction debt for longâ€lived wetland specialist vascular plants: in wetlands, which substantially lost patch area, current species richness of longâ€lived specialist vascular plants was higher than would have been expected based on current patch area. Additionally and besides current wetland area, historical area also explained current species richness of these species in a substantial and significant way. No evidence for an extinction debt in bryophytes was found. 4. The possible unpaid extinction debt in the wetlands of the canton of ZÃ¼rich is an appeal to nature conservation, which has the possibility to prevent likely future extinctions of species through specific conservation measures. In particular, a further reduction in wetlands must be prevented and restoration measures must be taken to increase the number of wetlands.","bryophytes ; extinction debt ; habitat area ; habitat fragmentation ; nature conservation ; vascular plants ; Ecology ; QH540-549.5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396007","2020","Wiley","2020 FEB","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","10","3","1264","1277","10.1002/ece3.5980","2045-7758","WOS:000508506800001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jamin, Anine et al.

We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land-use history from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, to test for an extinction debt in relation to species-specific extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presenceâ€“absence of 36 plant species were first parameterized using data from Lincolnshire, where forest cover has been relatively low (âˆ¼5â€“8%) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory, for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant, where forest cover was reduced from âˆ¼25% to <10% between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5%). As a consequence, the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus, more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover.","Environmental Science ; Ecology","https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.C.3299021.V1","2016","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2006 MAR","ECOLOGY","87","3","542","548","10.1890/05-1182","0012-9658","WOS:000236289600002","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mark Vellend et al.

But a consensus about the prevalence of extinctions debts is hindered by a multiplicity of methods and a lack of comparisons among habitats. We applied three contrasting speciesâ€“area relationship methods to test for plant community extinction debts in three habitats which had different degradation histories over the last century: calcareous grassland, heathland and woodland. These methods differ in their data requirements, with the first two using information on past and current habitat area alongside current species richness, whilst the last method also requires data on past species richness. The most dataâ€intensive, and hence arguably most reliable method, identified extinction debts across all habitats for specialist species, whilst the other methods did not. All methods detected an extinction debt in calcareous grassland, which had undergone the most severe degradation. We conclude that some methods failed to detect an extinction debt, particularly in habitats that have undergone moderate degradation.

"JOUR","en","Lafuite, Anne-Sophie and Denise, G. and Loreau, Michel","Sustainable Land-use Management Under Biodiversity Lag Effects","The destruction of natural habitats for agricultural production results in local biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss in turn affects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forward-looking policies for the long-term sustainability of humanâ€“nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win effects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of efficient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics. ; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Extinction debt; Social-ecological system; Sustainability; Land tax;","Land tax ; Sustainability ; Social-ecological system ; Ecosystem services ; Extinction debt ; Biodiversity ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800918305585","2018","HAL CCSD ; Elsevier","2018 DEC","ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS","154",NA,"272","281","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.08.003","0921-8009 and 1873-6106","WOS:000446282700024","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lafuite, Anne-Sophie et al.

This article will distinguish four types of environmental justice and link them to questions of neoliberalism and altruism. First, environmental justice seeks to redress inequitable distribution of environmental burdens to vulnerable groups and economically disadvantaged populations. Second, environmental justice highlights the developed and developing countriesâ€™ unequal exposure to environmental risks and benefits. Third, temporal environmental justice refers to the issues associated with intergenerational justice or concern for future generations of humans. In all three cases, environmental justice entails equitable distribution of burdens and benefits to different nations or social groups. By contrast, ecological justice involves biospheric egalitarianism or justice between species. This article will focus on ecological justice since the rights of non-human species lags behind social justice debates and discuss the implications of including biospheric egalitarianism in environmental justice debates.","Environmental justice ; Ecological justice ; Altruism ; Biospheric egalitarianism ; Environmental ethics ; Neoliberalism","http://www.earth-perspectives.com/content/1/1/8","2014","BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part2.ris",1,"Kopnina, Helen (2014) Environmental Justice and Biospheric Egalitarianism: Reflecting on a Normative-Philosophical View of Human-Nature Relationship. <i>Gen</i>.

In relation to security matters, the question is how to find the best information to produce relevant and useful intelligence, and then what is the best method to understand that information and develop the appropriate responses. This task has traditionally been the domain of the varying intelligence agencies, who have cultivated an air of mystery and secrecy that is ill fitted to meet the demands of modern counter-terrorism, or even the level of information sharing that is required in the network-centric warfare championed by many in the Pentagon. As the information revolution continues and more individuals have more access to more and more information, it becomes clear that attempting to restrict and control information flows becomes an exercise in futility. It also is apparent that while society at large, and particularly the business community, have begun to embrace the potential offered by information technology advances, the intelligence community lags behind. This research paper will introduce two constructs for dealing with information flows that take full advantage of technological gains, while challenging traditional methods and assumptions about knowledge and knowledge management.

This, the authors believe, aligns with the views of many others, as it would solve the problem of author disambiguation. If every researcher had a unique identifier, there would be significant opportunities to provide even more services. These extensions are proposed in this paper.Design/methodology/approach - The authors discuss the bibliographic services that are currently available. This leads to a discussion of how these services could be developed and extended.Findings - The authors suggest a number of ways that a unique identifier for scientific authors could support many other areas of importance to the scientific community. This will provide a much more robust system that provides a much richer and more easily maintained, scientific environment.Originality/value - The scientific community lags behind most other communities with regard to the way it identifies individuals. Even if the current vision for a unique identifier for authors was to become more widespread, there would still be many areas where the community could improve its operations.

However, though the impact of these pressures on biodiversity is substantial, it could be seriously underestimated if population declines of plants and animals lag behind contemporary environmental degradation. Here, we test for such a delay in impact by relating numbers of threatened species appearing on national red lists to historical and contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. Across 22 European countries, the proportions of vascular plants, bryophytes, mammals, reptiles, dragonflies, and grasshoppers facing medium-to-high extinction risks are more closely matched to indicators of socioeconomic pressures (i.e., human population density, per capita gross domestic product, and a measure of land use intensity) from the early or mid-, rather than the late, 20th century. We conclude that, irrespective of recent conservation actions, large-scale risks to biodiversity lag considerably behind contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. The negative impact of human activities on current biodiversity will not become fully realized until several decades into the future. Mitigating extinction risks might be an even greater challenge if temporal delays mean many threatened species might already be destined toward extinction.","extinction debt ; socioeconomic history ; time lag ; Animals ; Humans ; Multivariate Analysis ; Species Specificity ; Models ; Biological ; Socioeconomic Factors ; Europe ; Extinction ; Endangered Species ; 069902 Global Change Biology ; 160403 Social and Cultural Geography ; 060311 Speciation and Extinction ; 05 Environmental Sciences","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3645564","2013","National Academy of Sciences","2013 APR 30","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","110","18","7342","7347","10.1073/pnas.1216303110","0027-8424","WOS:000318682300054","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Dullinger, Stefan et al.

Designed to preserve the genetic information for organisms of interest, these banks also indirectly preserve organismsâ€™ associated microbiomes, including fungi associated with plant tissues. Studies of fungal biodiversity lag far behind those of macroorganisms, such as plants, and estimates of global fungal richness are still widely debated. Utilizing previously collected specimens to study patterns of fungal diversity could significantly increase our understanding of overall patterns of biodiversity from snapshots in time. Here, we investigated the fungi inhabiting the phylloplane among species of the endemic Hawaiian plant genus, Clermontia (Campanulaceae). Utilizing next generation DNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered approximately 1,780 fungal operational taxonomic units from just 20 DNA bank samples collected throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. Using these historical samples, we tested the macroecological pattern of decreasing community similarity with decreasing geographic proximity. We found a significant distance decay pattern among Clermontia associated fungal communities.

In this paper we introduce a new library called Bohrium.rb. Bohrium.rb acts as a front end for the Bohrium framework, which generates and runs JIT-compiled OpenMP/OpenCL kernels. It currently supports Python/NumPy and C++, however as it is built of processes communicating hierarchically to each other, we can replace the front ends with new ones. This new Ruby front end is described with examples and is then compared to the standard library and an already established Ruby library Numo/Narray, where Bohrium.rb seems to be faster for still larger matrix calculations. This is also the trend we have seen in similar areas with Bohrium, being faster once its overhead has been amortized.","Bohrium ; JIT-compile ; OpenCL ; OpenMP ; Parallel computing ; Ruby","https://curis.ku.dk/portal/da/publications/bohriumrb--the-ruby-front-end(54877d9f-3842-4fbb-a157-01db4de8d5d6).html","2019","IMIA and IOS Press",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part2.ris",1,"Larsen, Mads Ohm et al.

Rapid distributional and compositional shifts in soil microbial communities, especially ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, under climate change are also expected as an indirect effect of the impacts on vegetation. However, and despite the potential consequences on ecosystem functioning, they have seldom been addressed. Here we test the hypothesis that distributional shifts in soil ECM fungal communities will follow climate-driven tree upward migration in a fir forest-high elevation shrubland ecotone. Using Illumina Miseq sequencing, we compare the ECM fungal community associated to roots of adult Abies pinsapo trees at the tree-line with that of individuals involved in the altitudinal advance above it. Our data showed a decreasing trend in ECM fungal species abundance, richness, and proportion of species with epigeous fruiting bodies toward higher altitudes above the tree-line. Agaricales, Boletales and Pezizales were the fungal orders most frequently shared between host-individuals from the tree-line and the upward-migration area. In the latter, the ECM fungal community was mainly affected by the distance from the tree-line. Our results, together with the fact that the tree upward-migration process began several decades ago, suggest that (i) there is a high host-symbiont specificity for the ECM fungal community associated with the relic species Abies pinsapo, (ii) the altitudinal shift in the ECM fungal community lags well behind climate-driven tree upward migration in this forest-high elevation shrubland ecotone, and (iii) ECM dispersal limitation (distance from the forest-edge source) is an important factor controlling the speed of ECM upward migration.","XXXXXX - Unknown ; soil microbiology ; ectomycorrhizas ; plant ecology ; climatic changes ; shrubs","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107545","2019","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","2019 OCT","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","137",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107545","0038-0717 and 1879-3428","WOS:000489066300002","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Alvarez Garrido , Lucia et al.

The community dynamics shaping this process have been proposed to vary between temperature-limited alpine plant communities and those that are both temperature and moisture limited. In nine sites across the xeric alpine zone in the White Mountains, California, USA, we experimentally increased summertime temperature and precipitation for three seasons and quantified community responses with a climatic niche analysis. We asked if thermophilization occurred in response to experimental heating, and if this effect was ameliorated by experimental watering. Under experimentally warmer conditions, we found no change in the mean community-weighted climatic niche (CCN); however, thermophilization of this community was observed based on a shift in the seventy-fifth percentile of the CCN and an increase in the proportional abundance of the hottest, driest adapted species. In addition, total vegetation abundance increased and species richness decreased with heating. Experimental watering did not ameliorate these effects of heating. Together, these results suggest that warming in arid alpine areas may result in less diverse plant communities dominated by hot, dry associated species, although short-term responses may be limited because of community lags.","alpine ; arid ; climate change ; community climatic niche ; thermophilization ; Environmental sciences ; GE1-350 ; Ecology ; QH540-549.5","https://doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2019.1618148","2019","Taylor & Francis Group","2019","ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH","51","1","201","214","10.1080/15230430.2019.1618148","1523-0430 and 1938-4246","WOS:000486105800015","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","ABINGDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Oldfather, Meagan F. et al.

It is concluded that the Russian scientific community lags in the development of these sciences from the world scientific thought. Special attention is paid to the works and ideas of S. Kuznets and Amartya Sen as outstanding researchers of the interrelationships between the population and the economy. It is emphasized that their contribution was not only theoretical but also of practical importance. The importance of G. Myrdalâ€™s works for modern studies of the consequences of population aging is considered. The article examines foreign training courses on â€œPopulation Economicsâ€, presented at the Universities of Wisconsin and McMaster, their analysis led to the conclusion that the preparation of textbooks on courses is less productive than the use of scientific articles in journals, containing more recent ideas and achievements of science. The author considers the system, proposed in the course Michel Grignon and Byron G. Spencer Â«The Economics of PopulationÂ» more preferable. The article substantiates the opinion that the economic theory of well-being should be the core of the population economy. It is concluded that the differences between economic demography and the economy of population are not just differences between the micro- and macro levels, as some authors write, but the transition to large scales and entropy.The author identifies three most important areas of demo-economic research, which include research in the field of human capital, international economic migration, especially remittance, analysis of the stratification of the population and society by the income in the global and national economies. One can single out the general area of interests of the population economy and economic demography in which these sciences are almost impossible to divide and in which only their joint research is effective: the economy of aging and the economy of generations.","economics of population ; economic demography ; human capital theory ; system of demographic sciences ; welfare economics ; Economics as a science ; HB71-74","https://doi.org/10.21686/2500-3925-2017-5-94-104","2017","Plekhanov Russian University of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part2.ris",1,"A.

However, the quality of genome assembly and annotation for several macaque species lags behind the human genome effort. Results To close this gap and enhance functional genomics approaches, we used a combination of de novo linked-read assembly and scaffolding using proximity ligation assay (HiC) to assemble the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) genome. This combinatorial method yielded large scaffolds at chromosome level with a scaffold N50 of 127.5 Mb; the 23 largest scaffolds covered 90% of the entire genome. This assembly revealed large-scale rearrangements between pig-tailed macaque chromosomes 7, 12, and 13 and human chromosomes 2, 14, and 15. We subsequently annotated the genome using transcriptome and proteomics data from personalized induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the same animal. Reconstruction of the evolutionary tree using whole-genome annotation and orthologous comparisons among 3 macaque species, human, and mouse genomes revealed extensive homology between human and pig-tailed macaques with regards to both pluripotent stem cell genes and innate immune gene pathways. Our results confirm that rhesus and cynomolgus macaques exhibit a closer evolutionary distance to each other than either species exhibits to humans or pig-tailed macaques. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that pig-tailed macaques can serve as an excellent animal model for the study of many human diseases particularly with regards to pluripotency and innate immune pathways.","Computer Science Applications ; Health Informatics","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7350979/","2020","Oxford University Press (OUP)","2020 JUL","GIGASCIENCE","9","7",NA,NA,"10.1093/gigascience/giaa069","2047-217X","WOS:000569171300001","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Article and Data Paper","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Roodgar, Morteza et al.

To date, our ability to study deep-sea species lags behind that of those inhabiting the photic zone limiting scientific data available for management. In particular, knowledge of horizontal movements is restricted to two locations; capture and recapture, with no temporal information on absolute animal locations between endpoints. To elucidate the horizontal movements of a large deep-sea fish, a novel tagging approach was adopted using the smallest available prototype satellite tag - the mark-report pop-up archival tag (mrPAT). Five Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) were equipped with multiple mrPATs as well as a standard archival satellite tag (miniPAT) that were programmed to release in sequence at 8-10 day intervals. The performance of the mrPATs was quantified. The tagging approach provided multiple locations per individual and revealed a previously unknown directed migration of Greenland sharks from the Canadian high Arctic to Northwest Greenland. All tags reported locations, however, the accuracy and time from expected release were variable among tags (average time to an accurate location from expected release = 30.8 h, range: 4.9-227.6 h). Average mrPAT drift rate estimated from best quality messages (LQ1,2,3) was 0.37 +/- 0.09 m/s indicating tags were on average 41.1 +/- 63.4 km (range: 6.5-303.1 km) from the location of the animal when they transmitted. mrPATs provided daily temperature values that were highly correlated among tags and with the miniPAT (70.8% of tag pairs were significant). In contrast, daily tilt sensor data were variable among tags on the same animal (12.5% of tag pairs were significant). Tracking large-scale movements of deep-sea fish has historically been limited by the remote environment they inhabit. The current study provides a new approach to document reliable coarse scale horizontal movements to understand migrations, stock structure and habitat use of large species. Opportunities to apply mrPATs to understand the movements of medium size fish, marine mammals and to validate retrospective movement modeling approaches based on archival data are presented.","Benthic ; Deep-sea ; Greenland shark ; Migration ; MiniPAT ; mrPAT ; Satellite telemetry ; Biology ; Life Sciences","https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/biologypub/1193","2018","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","2018 APR","DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS","134",NA,"32","40","10.1016/j.dsr.2018.03.002","0967-0637 and 1879-0119","WOS:000437817600004","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hussey, Nigel E. et al.

"GEN","en","Zhang, Guoshun","DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS IN AN URBANIZING WATERSHED","Stormwater management, like many other real-life problems, is always characterized with competing and sometimes conflicting objectives. Decision-makers have a great need to identify and choose the most cost-effective measures when managing stormwater runoff, and this has become particularly important in todays economic downturn. The last decade has witnessed a transformation of stormwater management concepts from the traditional centralized approach to the low impact development (LID) approach. The LID approach, while potentially having hydrologic benefits over the traditional approach and quickly gaining popularity among the stormwater community, lags behind in consistent hydrologic assessment methods due to its relatively recent emergence. The lack of methods to quantify the LID scenario hydrologic benefits, in turn, prevents the development of optimization algorithms that can help identify cost-effective LID implementation scenarios at the watershed level. In this study a generic LID scenario optimization framework was developed to provide a consistent approach for identifying cost-effective LID implementation alternatives in post-development watersheds. The developed LID scenario optimization framework consisted of three major components: a U.S. Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) stormwater management model (SWMM) for hydrologic simulations, a representation scheme for simulating LID scenarios in SWMM, and an integration algorithm that links the LID-SWMM representation to the optimizer of Îµ-non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (Îµ-NSGAII). The objective of the optimization framework was to minimize the total cost and the total runoff volume from the post-development watershed, while using the pre-development peak runoff rate as a constraint. The optimization framework was then tested for applicability for the Fox Hollow Watershed (FHW) in central Pennsylvania. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) was used for simulating hydrologic runoff conditions from the pre-development, post-development, and LID scenarios of the case study watershed. The SWMM model was parameterized for the FHW and then calibrated and verified against two monitoring stations within the watershed. Representation schemes for the integrated management practices (IMPs) of green roof, bio-retention, and porous pavement were developed within SWMM, using existing components of flow divider, storage unit, weir, and orifice. The representation schemes for bio-retention and porous pavement were tested against the long-term monitoring data from the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center (UNHSC). The results showed that the average peak flow reduction percentages of the SWMM representation schemes were within 10% of the UNHSC observed peak flow reduction percentages for bio-retention and porous pavement. The case study watershed of FHW in this study is a small watershed in central Pennsylvania. Averaged verification results of the SWMM model in FHW showed that the calibrated model over-predicted peak flow by 33% at Station #1 and under-predicted peak flow by 19% at Station #2. Post-development scenarios were assumed for the Mitchell Tract and Flower Garden areas within the watershed. The IMPs of green roof, bio-retention, and porous pavement were used to create an assumed LID scenario in the post-development watershed. Runoff conditions from the LID scenario were compared to those from the pre-development watershed. The results indicated that the assumed LID scenario was capable of maintaining the pre-development peak flow rate from the watershed for 1-, 2-, 10-, and 100-year 24-hour design events. The LID optimization framework was created by building the SWMM model as a subroutine into the optimizer of Îµ-NSGAII. The optimization framework was capable of searching through various IMP combinations and identifying the tradeoff front between total runoff volume and the total LID scenario cost. The pre-development peak flow rate was built into the optimization framework as a constraint to be in accordance with local stormwater ordinances. When implemented to the case study watershed of FHW, the developed LID optimization framework was ran for 10,000 scenario evaluations for 1-, 2-, 10-, and 100-year 24-hour design events. A total number of 27, 20, 23, and 23 near-optimal LID scenarios were identified for the four design events, respectively. The developed LID optimization framework could help stormwater associates to evaluate, compare, and optimize various LID scenarios. The LID representation scheme in the optimization framework accounted for physical processes such as infiltration, percolation, ponding, and underdrains in a LID scenario. The SWMM based representation schemes for bio-retention and porous pavement were compared to the long-term monitored data at the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center (UNHSC), and both representations had a difference of less than 10% as compared to the observed average peak flow reduction percentages. The distributed SWMM model took into account the spatial-variability of the LID implementations (and thus the timing of the convoluted hydrographs) within a watershed. The Îµ-NSGAII optimizer could efficiently search through potential LID scenario designs and identify the tradeoff between total LID scenario cost and total runoff volume. The generic structure of the developed optimization framework also allowed for the accommodation of other stormwater control targets.","Agricultural and Biological Engineering","http://etda.libraries.psu.edu/theses/approved/WorldWideIndex/ETD-4592/index.html","2009","Penn State",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part2.ris",1,"Zhang, Guoshun (2009) Development of a Multi-Objective Optimization Framework for Implementing Low Impact Development Scenarios in an Urbanizing Watershed. <i>Gen</i>.

It is concluded that the Russian scientific community lags in the development of these sciences from the world scientific thought. Special attention is paid to the works and ideas of S. Kuznets and Amartya Sen as outstanding researchers of the interrelationships between the population and the economy. It is emphasized that their contribution was not only theoretical but also of practical importance. The importance of G. Myrdalâ€™s works for modern studies of the consequences of population aging is considered. The article examines foreign training courses on â€œPopulation Economicsâ€, presented at the Universities of Wisconsin and McMaster, their analysis led to the conclusion that the preparation of textbooks on courses is less productive than the use of scientific articles in journals, containing more recent ideas and achievements of science. The author considers the system, proposed in the course Michel Grignon and Byron G. Spencer Â«The Economics of PopulationÂ» more preferable. The article substantiates the opinion that the economic theory of well-being should be the core of the population economy. It is concluded that the differences between economic demography and the economy of population are not just differences between the micro- and macro levels, as some authors write, but the transition to large scales and entropy.The author identifies three most important areas of demo-economic research, which include research in the field of human capital, international economic migration, especially remittance, analysis of the stratification of the population and society by the income in the global and national economies. One can single out the general area of interests of the population economy and economic demography in which these sciences are almost impossible to divide and in which only their joint research is effective: the economy of aging and the economy of generations. ; Ğ’ ÑÑ‚Ğ°Ñ‚ÑŒĞµ Ğ¿Ñ€ĞµĞ´Ğ¿Ñ€Ğ¸Ğ½ÑÑ‚Ğ° Ğ¿Ğ¾Ğ¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ĞºĞ° ÑƒÑ‚Ğ¾Ñ‡Ğ½Ğ¸Ñ‚ÑŒ ÑĞ¾Ğ¾Ñ‚Ğ½Ğ¾ÑˆĞµĞ½Ğ¸Ğµ ÑĞºĞ¾Ğ½Ğ¾Ğ¼Ğ¸Ñ‡ĞµÑĞºĞ¾Ğ¹ Ğ´ĞµĞ¼Ğ¾Ğ³Ñ€Ğ°Ñ„Ğ¸Ğ¸ Ğ¸ ÑĞºĞ¾Ğ½Ğ¾Ğ¼Ğ¸ĞºĞ¸ Ğ½Ğ°Ñ€Ğ¾Ğ´Ğ¾Ğ½Ğ°ÑĞµĞ»ĞµĞ½Ğ¸Ñ ĞºĞ°Ğº Ğ²Ğ°Ğ¶Ğ½ĞµĞ¹ÑˆĞ¸Ñ… Ğ½Ğ°ÑƒÑ‡Ğ½Ñ‹Ñ… Ğ½Ğ°Ğ¿Ñ€Ğ°Ğ²Ğ»ĞµĞ½Ğ¸Ğ¹ ÑĞ¾Ğ²Ñ€ĞµĞ¼ĞµĞ½Ğ½Ñ‹Ñ… Ğ¸ÑÑĞ»ĞµĞ´Ğ¾Ğ²Ğ°Ğ½Ğ¸Ğ¹.

Although changes to the occurrence and abundance of species likely have cascading effects (e.g. on species of other trophic levels, genes, community structure and ecosystem processes), current concepts addressing lagged biodiversity responses are limited to single drivers affecting a few biodiversity components (e.g. extinction debt in terms of species numbers or population size). Little attention has been paid to the interacting and cumulative nature of time-lag phenomena. Here, we synthesize current knowledge, mechanisms and implications of delayed biodiversity responses and propose a cumulative biodiversity lags-framework' which aims to integrate lagged responses of various components of biological organization.LocationGlobal.ResultsEffects of change in environmental forcing are transmitted along a series of linked cause-effect relationships which act on different biodiversity components (e.g. individuals, populations, species, communities). We show that lagged responses to environmental forcing are caused by different mechanisms (e.g. metapopulation dynamics, dispersal limitation, successional dynamics), which operate sequentially on these intermediary links. Lags manifest themselves on the respective biodiversity component which changes over time; the full relaxation time of a focal system will therefore depend on the aggregate length of different lags. We elucidate key mechanisms and circumstances which are likely to cause cumulative lagged responses, and propose research avenues to improve understanding of cumulative biodiversity lags.Main conclusionsThe failure to give adequate consideration to widespread cumulative time-lags often masks the full extent of biodiversity changes that have already been triggered. Effects that are particularly relevant for human livelihoods (e.g. changes in the provision of ecosystem services) may emerge with the most pronounced delay. Accordingly, the consideration of appropriate temporal scales should become a key topic in future work at the science-policy interface.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 MAY","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","21","5","534","547","10.1111/ddi.12312","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000352586400005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN","ï»¿TY  - JOUR",NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Essl, Franz et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Gupta, H. and Dube, L. C.","Addressing biodiversity in climate change discourse: Paris mechanisms hold more promise","Forests, by acting as carbon sinks, mitigate the effects of climate change. Forests, and their associated biodiversity, on the other hand are directly and indirectly impacted by changing climatic conditions as well as elements of climate policy. While the climate change gained prominence in political and public discourse, biodiversity lagged behind, so did the adaptation under the existing market mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. These mechanisms have resulted in loss of natural forest cover and growth of monocultures in pursuit of carbon credits. The adaptation gap can be addressed by new mechanisms: Cooperative approaches, non-market approaches (NMAs) and Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM) established by the Paris Agreement which accords equal importance to mitigation and adaptation. This paper compares NMAs with Kyoto mechanisms and studies their role in environmental and social safeguards. It addresses three main aspects: (i) Role of climate policies in biodiversity conservation; (ii) Creating socio-environmental safeguards in forestry, and; (iii)Importance and role of NMAs in encouraging forest protection. It comes to the conclusion that lessons learnt from the on-going projects must be accounted for while implementing NMAs, which offer better options for streamlining climate change and biodiversity actions through joint mitigation and adaptation approach.",NA,NA,"2018","COMMONWEALTH FORESTRY ASSOC","2018 MAR","INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW","20","1","104","114","10.1505/146554818822824282","1465-5489 and 2053-7778","WOS:000431064600008","CRIB, DINCHOPE, CRAVEN ARRMS SY7 9JJ, SHROPSHIRE, ENGLAND","Article","CRAVEN ARRMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gupta, H. et al.

In general, knowledge of marine biodiversity lags behind. This work aims to analyze the structural features of macrobenthic communities in unconsolidated substrates in Todos os Santos Bay (TSB) in relation to the environment. TSB is 1086 km2 in area, and is located between 12 degrees 35' to 13 degrees 07' S and 38 degrees 29' to 38 degrees 48' W. Thirty-two stations were sampled in 1997 using a van Veen grab and a dredge to sample sediments, and bottles to sample near-bottom water. The sediment was highly heterogeneous, with 12 textural types. Three faunistic associations were defined using Twinspan cluster and discriminant analyses of abundance data for the families of Polychaeta, Mollusca Bivalvia and Echinodermata. However, faunal distribution was shown by DCA to be continuous. The first association, occurring in siliciclastic sandy sediments and located in the bay mouth, showed intermediate richness. The second and richest association occurred in mixed sands with higher carbonate content, the preferred habitat of 24% of the families collected. The third association, occurring in muddy sediments from the northern to the central portion of TSB (47% of the stations), showed the lowest richness and abundance values, with some families not recorded. Biodiversity, in terms of richness and abundance, was proportional to carbonate content, median grain size, and the percentage of the coarse sediment fraction; and inversely proportional to the percentage of mud.

"JOUR",NA,"Brunet, Jorg and Hedwall, Per-Ola and Lindgren, Jessica and Cousins, Sara A. O.","Immigration credit of temperate forest herbs in fragmented landscapes-Implications for restoration of habitat connectivity","In many agricultural landscapes, it is important to restore networks of forests to provide habitat and stepping stones for forest specialist taxa. More knowledge is, however, needed on how to facilitate the immigration of such taxa in restored forest patches. Here, we present the first chronosequence study to quantify the dynamics of immigration credits of forest specialist plants in post-arable forest patches. We studied the distribution of herbaceous forest specialist plant species in 54 post-arable broadleaved forest patches along gradients of age (20-140 years since forest establishment), distance from ancient forest (0-2,600 m) and patch area (0.5-9.6 ha). With linear mixed models, we estimated the effects of these factors on species richness, patch means of four dispersal-related plant traits and with generalized linear models on the occurrence of 20 individual species. Post-arable forest patch age and spatial isolation from ancient forest, but not patch size, were important predictors for species richness of forest specialists, suggesting that also small patches are valuable for habitat connectivity. Compared to species richness in ancient forest stands, the immigration credit was reduced by more than 90% after 80 years in post-arable forest patches contiguous to ancient forest compared to 40% after 80 years and 60% after 140 years in isolated patches (at least 100 m to next forest). Tall-growing species with adaptations to long-distance dispersal were faster colonizers, whereas species with heavy diaspores and clonal growth were slower to colonize. Synthesis and applications. We show that post-arable oak plantations have a high potential for restoration of forest herb vegetation. Dispersal-related plant traits play a key role in explaining interspecific differences among forest specialists. To facilitate forest herb immigration across all functional groups in agricultural landscapes, we suggest to create clusters of relatively small new forest patches nearby older forest with source populations.",NA,NA,"2021","WILEY","2021 OCT","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","58","10","2195","2206","10.1111/1365-2664.13975","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000687463700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brunet, Jorg et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Ellis, Christopher J.","When is translocation required for the population recovery of old-growth epiphytes in a reforested landscape?","It is often assumed that species recolonization follows from the restoration of key habitat structure. Thus, forest restoration focuses on the recovery of trees into deforested landscapes, so that a multitude of associated organisms can achieve ""colonization credit"" and recolonize from remnant source populations into restored habitat. This opportunity for recolonization exists because species vulnerable to habitat loss may experience an ""extinction debt,"" during which their remnant populations decline only slowly to equilibrium with a deforested landscape. These persistent but declining populations become propagule sources for recolonization. To test limits to ""colonization credit,"" this study focused on old-growth dependent lichen epiphytes, using a simulation to identify a hypothetical threshold at which: (1) the number of remnant populations, and (2) their population sizes, are too low to achieve recolonization and population recovery, despite efforts placed into forest restoration. The results show that for a landscape scenario relevant to the industrialized temperate zone, with less than 5% of old-growth forest remaining, and ambitions for restoration to circa 10-15% forest cover, there is a failure to achieve population recovery over long timescales (i.e. within 600 years), making translocation a necessary option.

"JOUR",NA,"Kolk, Jens and Naaf, Tobias and Wulf, Monika","Paying the colonization credit: converging plant species richness in ancient and post-agricultural forests in NE Germany over five decades","Massive historical land cover changes in the Central European lowlands have resulted in a forest distribution that now comprises small remnants of ancient forests and more recently established post-agricultural forests. Here, land-use history is considered a key driver of recent herb-layer community changes, where an extinction debt in ancient forest remnants and/or a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests are being paid over time. On a regional scale, these payments should in theory lead toward a convergence in species richness between ancient and post-agricultural forests over time. In this study, we tested this assumption with a resurvey of 117 semi-permanent plots in the well-studied deciduous forests of the Prignitz region (Brandenburg, NE Germany), where we knew that the plant communities of post-agricultural stands exhibit a colonization credit while the extinction debt in ancient stands has largely been paid. We compared changes in the species richness of all herb layer species, forest specialists and ancient forest indicator species between ancient and post-agricultural stands with linear mixed effect models and determined the influence of patch connectivity on the magnitude of species richness changes. Species richness increased overall, but the richness of forest specialists increased significantly more in post-agricultural stands and was positively influenced by higher patch connectivity, indicating a convergence in species richness between the ancient and postagricultural stands. Furthermore, the richness of ancient forest indicator species only increased significantly in post-agricultural stands. For the first time, we were able to verify a gradual payment of the colonization credit in post-agricultural forest stands using a comparison of actual changes in temporal species richness.",NA,NA,"2017","SPRINGER","2017 MAR","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","26","3","735","755","10.1007/s10531-016-1271-y","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000393643700014","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kolk, Jens et al.

F. and Carmona, Carlos P. and Partel, Meelis","Temporal lags in observed and dark diversity in the Anthropocene","Understanding biodiversity changes in the Anthropocene (e.g. due to climate and land-use change) is an urgent ecological issue. This important task is challenging because global change effects and species responses are dependent on the spatial scales considered. Furthermore, responses are often not immediate. However, both scale and time delay issues can be tackled when, at each study site, we consider dynamics in both observed and dark diversity. Dark diversity includes those species in the region that can potentially establish and thrive in the local sites' conditions but are currently locally absent. Effectively, dark diversity connects biodiversity at the study site to the regional scales and defines the site-specific species pool (observed and dark diversity together). With dark diversity, it is possible to decompose species gains and losses into two space-related components: one associated with local dynamics (species moving from observed to dark diversity and vice versa) and another related to gains and losses of site-specific species pool (species moving to and from the pool after regional immigration, regional extinction or change in local ecological conditions). Extinction debt and immigration credit are useful to understand dynamics in observed diversity, but delays might happen in species pool changes as well. In this opinion piece we suggest that considering both observed and dark diversity and their temporal dynamics provides a deeper understanding of biodiversity changes. Considering both observed and dark diversity creates opportunities to improve conservation by allowing to identify species that are likely to go regionally extinct as well as foreseeing which of the species that newly arrive to the region are more likely to colonize local sites. Finally, by considering temporal lags and species gains and losses in observed and dark diversity, we combine phenomena at both spatial and temporal scales, providing a novel tool to examine biodiversity change in the Anthropocene.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 JUN","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","26","6","3193","3201","10.1111/gcb.15093","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000525977700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Trindade, Diego P.

This might result in species surpluses or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species' habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other) and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover, forest species richness and both richness and cover of vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.",NA,NA,"2021","SPRINGER","2021 FEB","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","30","2","365","384","10.1007/s10531-020-02094-3","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000607992700002","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tello-Garcia, Elena et al.

In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management. Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit, whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland fragmentation, and with particular species' life history traits. Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization. This may suggest that restoring the pollinator community is an important bottleneck in calcareous grassland restoration.",NA,NA,"2012","UNIVERSITE LAVAL","2012","ECOSCIENCE","19","1","21","28","10.2980/19-1-3460","1195-6860","WOS:000303931200003","PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA","Article","ST FOY",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gijbels, Pieter et al.

Objectives We aimed to disentangle the role of forest connectivity and climatic aridity in the assembly of woody plant communities present in expanding Mediterranean forests by studying species with different types of dispersal. Methods We used a space-for-time approach in recent (post 1980), middle-aged (1956-1980) and long-established forests (pre-1956) along an aridity and forest connectivity gradient in NE Spain. We recorded woody canopy and understory species and classified them as either vertebrate-, non-vertebrate- or human-dispersed species (i.e., crops). Results Species turnover between forests of different ages was limited to particular species and did not give rise to colonization credits determined by plant dispersal type. Connectivity and aridity drove understory richness in a similar way in forests of different ages. Within this general pattern, non-vertebrate-dispersed species were especially promoted by benign conditions. Sites with high forest connectivity had either the richest or the most impoverished understories given, respectively, low or high aridity. Thus, the rescue effect was modulated by aridity, which acted as a limiting factor. Conclusions Mediterranean forest richness and composition are strongly dependent on climatic constraints and the 'rescue effects' (connectivity) originating in surrounding forest areas.

Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, this paper examines the likely consequences for the survival of species of different scenarios of forest management and conservation. The results point to the conclusion that it generally pays to concentrate the efforts of improving forest quality at certain areas rather than to spread the same total effort evenly and therefore thinly throughout the entire forest landscape. The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species. The greatest positive effect is obtained if forests located close to the existing remnants of biologically diverse forests are restored, which would facilitate the migration of target species to the restored forests.",NA,NA,"2000","FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD","2000","ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI","37","4","271","280",NA,"0003-455X","WOS:000166643700006","P O BOX 17, FIN-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND","Article and Proceedings Paper","UNIV HELSINKI",NA,"Symposium on Northern Dimension to Biodiversity - From Arctic to Boreal Environments",NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hanski, I (2000) Extinction Debt and Species Credit in Boreal Forests: Modelling the Consequences of Different Approaches to Biodiversity Conservation. <i>Jour</i>.

"JOUR",NA,"Toeroek, Peter and Helm, Aveliina","Ecological theory provides strong support for habitat restoration","The involvement of ecological theory in habitat restoration has significantly increased in the past decade. However, despite the fact that the field of restoration ecology has grown academically strong in recent years, there are still visible gaps between the advancing discipline of theoretical ecology and current approaches of habitat restoration. We propose bridging these gaps by linking recent developments in theoretical plant ecology with the main questions every restoration practitioner should ask, namely: Q1) How to identify target species and baseline conditions for restoration of the selected habitat?; Q2) When can one count on spontaneous dispersal and when are additional efforts required for facilitating dispersal of desired species?; Q3) Which factors determine the successful establishment of target species and assembly of target communities?; and Q4) What time-scale needs to be considered for the evaluation of species colonisation and restoration success? Knowledge and experience accumulated in practical restoration can considerably benefit theoretical ecology for example by improving the understanding on (i) temporal changes in community, (ii) species assembly, (iii) species dispersal and establishment and (iv) landscape-scale dynamics of biodiversity. We emphasise that to improve joint thinking of practical restoration and theoretical ecology, restoration-problem-driven theoretical research is necessary. We suggest either (i) to translate and link the current findings of theoretical ecology to restoration strategies; and/or (ii) to summarise practical restoration needs by formulation of questions and testable hypotheses based on theory.

The model is general and predicts how transition behaviors of extinction may accumulate according to different combination of random drift, immigration rate, emigration rate, and the degree of habitat destruction. We show that emigration, the areal size of the destroyed habitat, and initial species abundance distribution can impact the total biodiversity loss in an intact local area. Among these, the species abundance distribution plays the most deterministic role, as it directly determines the initial species richness in the local target area. In contrast, immigration was found to slow down total biodiversity loss and can drive the emergence of species credits (i.e., a gain of species) over time. However, emigration process would increase the extinction risk of species and accelerate biodiversity loss. Finally but notably, we found that a shift in the emigration rate after a habitat destruction event may be a new mechanism to generate species credits.

Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 JAN","OIKOS","125","1","107","116","10.1111/oik.02534","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000369953100013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Basnou, Corina et al.

To evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention (in this case, buffer strips along streams), we studied the bryophyte community once prior to, and twice after logging, comparing one buffer and one clear-cut plot (0.1 ha) in each of 13 riparian sites. We asked whether time-lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re-inventories, 2.5 and 10.5 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern. Although there were examples of recovering species in both clear-cuts and buffer strips, the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re-inventory. Even if the buffer strips displayed more time-lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear-cuts, the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear-cuts. The red-listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red-list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at <20% of predisturbance levels in clear-cuts and <60% in buffer strips in the last re-inventory. Synthesis and applications. We show that most extinctions of red-list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2.5 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear-cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 DEC","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","49","6","1316","1324","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02218.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000311855000013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hylander, Kristoffer et al.

Yet they can be harmed under the condition that impacts on their habitats are mitigated. This is known as the no-net loss principle. To do so, public regulators acknowledge conservation banks and endangered species credit production as the most robust policy instruments, as they allow for ecological restoration ahead of impacts. The aim of this paper is to show how endangered species credits, as 'environmental intangibles,' are designed and produced so as to meet two diverging objectives, that is, ensuring permanent conservation and attracting private investors. Permanent conservation is ensured through financial insurances, which tie environmental intangibles to a very tangible asset, land. Therefore, environmental credit-making is not only a matter of scientific measurement; as commodities crafted out of government regulation, environmental intangibles also need to be legally stabilized, including through the use of property and financial tools. This securement entails important production costs that limit investors' profits. Environmental field-level bureaucrats play a central role in understanding this tension, as they organize trade-offs between finance and conservation temporality so as to ensure the production of environmental intangibles permanently linked to land and ecosystems.",NA,NA,"2021","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","2021 SEP 3","JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY","14","5","549","563","10.1080/17530350.2020.1846593","1753-0350 and 1753-0369","WOS:000593366100001","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","ABINGDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Barral, Stephanie (2021) Conservation, Finance, Bureaucrats: Managing Time and Space in the Production of Environmental Intangibles. <i>Jour</i>.

These banks are managed in perpetuity and used to mitigate impacts occurring elsewhere to the species' habitat. We developed a species crediting methodology to assess conservation credits and debits for the endangered Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri) to support conservation banking. Our methodology is based on prior studies assessing relationships between population abundance and habitat parameters for the species. The methodology also incorporates ratings for piscivory risk, site location, and the abundance and status of existing and proximal populations. Our approach assigns more credits to functioning bank sites that support abundant, stable populations and requires more credits when impacted sites negatively affect these populations. Examples show the credit value calculations for determining baseline conditions and for assessing impacts to species habitat. Additional examples illustrate the incentives for creating habitats that support abundant, stable populations and the incentives for reducing the severity and duration of impacts to habitats. As the demand for economic development of prime fish habitat increases and as more conservation banks are developed, managers may benefit by developing similar crediting methodologies to promote adequate compensatory conservation for imperiled species.",NA,NA,"2010","WILEY","2010 JUN","FISHERIES","35","6","280","291","10.1577/1548-8446-35.6.280","0363-2415 and 1548-8446","WOS:000279066300007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Scheerer, P.

Does the proximity to potential source populations influence the forest species richness in recent hedgerows? Is there a difference in the dispersal potential of forest specialists found in recent and ancient hedgerows? How similar is the species composition between hedgerows of different ages? Location Southeastern Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Methods We investigated 30 hedgerows in a pairwise design to compare the species composition of ancient and recent hedgerows. Results While recent hedgerows already function as habitats for herbaceous forest specialists, they contain significantly fewer forest species than ancient hedgerows. Besides hedgerow age proximity to ancient forests, a wide shrub layer, high pH values and a low phosphorus content are also positively associated with the number of forest specialists. The similarity in species composition between recent and ancient hedgerows increases with the age of the recent hedgerow. Epizoochorous dispersal and reproduction by seed favour the colonisation of recent hedgerows by forest species. Most environmental and hedgerow structural parameters do not differ between the age categories except for pH, which is significantly higher in recent hedgerows.

We used a trait-based approach to understand their responses to landscape simplification and habitat fragmentation. We quantified landscape structure at three different years (1963, 1985, 2000) and sampled current plant and bird assemblages in twenty 1 km(2) landscape windows located along the Seine Valley (France). For each window, we calculated plant and bird species richness, Community Weighted Variance (CWV), and Community Weighted Mean (CWM) of five functional traits related to dispersal capacity, reproduction, and life-cycle. We detected non-random patterns of traits for both taxa. Plant and bird species richness was lower in simple landscapes. The functional variance of plant traits was higher in landscapes simple in configuration. Both plant and bird assemblages strongly responded to past landscapes, especially their traits related to reproduction and life-cycle.

O.","Connectivity and management enables fast recovery of plant diversity in new linear grassland elements","QuestionsHow does small linear grassland elements (paddy levees and road verges) contribute to plant diversity patterns in sites with modern or traditional management? Which factors determine small-scale plant species richness of small linear grassland elements in a Japanese agricultural landscape?LocationShiga Prefecture, Japan.MethodsAerial photos from 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2008 were used to investigate landscape changes and to measure landscape structures within a typical agricultural landscape (25km(2)). Plant diversity was investigated in ten paddy levees and ten road verges in each of four traditional (barely any land cover alterations after 1963) and five modern (almost completely changed after 1985) sites. -diversity (mean number of species per plot) and -diversity (total number of species) for all species, specialist and invasive species, respectively, were analysed in relation to site history types and landscape structures. Plot species richness was analysed in relation to site history type, patch age and width, proximity to forest and litter removal.ResultsIn total, 204 plant species were found, 55 species unique to traditional sites and 13 unique to modern sites. - and -diversity of paddy levees and road verges was significantly higher in traditional sites. Number of specialist species on paddy levees and number of invasive species in road verges was also higher in traditional sites. Age was the strongest predictor of plot species richness on levees; older levees supported higher species richness than younger ones. Litter removal was the strongest predictor (positive effect) of plot species richness in road verges.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the colonization credit of new levees in modern sites is decreasing quite rapidly as species quickly establish, approaching almost the same richness values as in traditional sites. However, long continuity of traditional management is still one of the most important contributors to plant diversity and crucial for many species. But small grassland elements can still be of great significance for preserving and enhancing plant diversity in otherwise depleted landscapes, as long as they are managed and connected throughout the landscape.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 JAN","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","27","1","19","28","10.1111/jvs.12344","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000367816400005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jakobsson, Simon et al.

Especially for habitat specialists such as several forest plants they can provide important refuge habitats. Objectives This study aims to examine whether there is an extinction debt for forest plants in hedgerows. Methods In a study area in Northern Germany that had lost 47% of the hedgerow network over the past 120 years, hedgerows were mapped for the presence of forest vascular plants. In a multi-model approach, we compared the explanatory power of present and historical landscape variables and habitat quality on diversity patterns. Results The change in landscape configuration had no effect on the species richness of forest plants in hedgerows, i.e. there was no sign of an extinction debt. The best explanatory variable was the hedgerow width with more species found in wider hedgerows. This demonstrates the importance of including local habitat variables in the study of extinction debt. For ancient woodland indicator species models including both the landscape configuration and habitat variables were superior to simple models. The best models included the historical distance to the nearest forest, suggesting an extinction debt. Counterintuitively, a high density of hedgerows had a negative influence on species richness, most likely because hedgerows are narrower in areas with higher densities due to land-saving measures by farmers. There was also a negative correlation between hedgerow density and the hedgerow proximity to forests.

In the Laurentian Great Lakes, wetlands have been significantly lost as a result of agricultural land-use practice, yet high species richness and several at-risk fishes persist. These patterns lead to the hypothesis that Great Lakes wetland fishes are in extinction debt, meaning there is a time lag between habitat loss and local extinction. To test this hypothesis, we sampled current species richness of wetland-specialist fishes in protected and unprotected wetlands in the Lake Erie basin. We predicted species richness in unprotected wetlands using parameter estimates (slope and intercept) from protected wetlands. Extinction debt was measured as a positive difference between predicted and observed species richness. We determined how much area would be required to support current species richness and compared this to minimum-area requirements for eight at-risk fishes. Species richness was significantly higher than predicted in unprotected wetlands, indicating that fishes in them are in extinction debt. This result indicates that there is time available to restore disturbed wetlands and prevent local extinction. We identified 17 wetlands of high priority for restoration (> 10 species bound for extinction) and determined that the restoration of 178 km(2) of wetland habitat would reduce the risk of future biodiversity loss. This is the first direct study of extinction debt in freshwater fishes.

Impacted communities can exhibit transient dynamics in response to such environmental changes, where slow extinctions and immigration delay the arrival to a new equilibrium. Life history traits such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt, but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs for vascular plants and three insect taxa.LocationSouth-eastern Sweden.MethodWe sampled current species richness of habitat specialist and generalist butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and vascular plants in 45 dry to mesic semi-natural grassland fragments of various size and degree of connectivity, and situated in landscapes with contrasting land use conversion history. Habitat loss was estimated in each landscape by comparing modern maps to ~45year old digitized aerial photographs. An extinction debt can be assumed if historical habitat size and connectivity better explain current species distribution than current habitat variables do.ResultsBees responded rapidly to habitat loss possibly as a result of their primary nesting resource being destroyed. Interestingly, species richness of specialist plants was best explained by historical habitat connectivity, richness of hoverflies by historical habitat area, and richness of butterflies by both historical habitat area and connectivity, indicating extinction debt for these taxa. Habitat generalist butterflies and hoverflies, but not plants and bees, exhibited extinction debt mainly in relation to habitat area.

"JOUR",NA,"Kimberley, Adam and Blackburn, G. Alan and Whyatt, J. Duncan and Smart, Simon M.","How well is current plant trait composition predicted by modern and historical forest spatial configuration?","There is increasing evidence to suggest that a delayed response of many forest species to habitat loss and fragmentation leads to the development of extinction debts and immigration credits in affected forest habitat. These time lags result in plant communities which are not well predicted by present day landscape structure, reducing the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and predictions for future change. Here, species richness data and mean values for five life history characteristics within deciduous broadleaved forest habitat across Great Britain were used to quantify the degree to which aspects of present day forest plant composition are best explained by modern or historical forest patch area. Ancient forest specialist richness, mean rarity and mean seed terminal velocity were not well predicted by modern patch area, implying the existence of a degree of lag in British forest patches. Mean seedbank persistence values were more closely related to modern patch area than historical, particularly in larger patches. The variation in response for different mean trait values suggests that species respond to landscape change at different rates depending upon their combinations of different trait states. Current forest understorey communities are therefore likely to consist of a mixture of declining species whose extinction debt is still to be paid, and faster colonising immigrant species. These results indicate that without management action, rare and threatened species of plant are likely to be lost in the future as a result of changes in forest spatial configuration that have already taken place. The lag seen here for rare specialist plants suggests however that there may still be scope to protect such species before they are lost from forest patches.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 JAN","ECOGRAPHY","39","1","67","76","10.1111/ecog.01607","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000368792500008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kimberley, Adam et al.

As these markets mature, participants are exploring the concept of credit stacking, whereby a conservation project or parcel produces different types of mitigation credits for multiple markets (such as wetland and endangered species credits or water quality and carbon sequestration credits). If these stacked credits are unbundled, they may be sold in different credit markets to offset impacts from different activities. Such transactions raise concerns about additionality, interagency coordination, verification of ecological improvements, monitoring and management, and transparency. This Article examines eight different credit stacking scenarios and the emerging rules that govern the sale of credits. Generally, there is diversity in how different federal and state agencies handle credit stacking, and they have not issued clear rules on when unbundling stacked credits is permissible. The Article closes with considerations that agencies could take into account in developing a credit stacking protocol to avoid double counting and ecological loss. The credit stacking scenario where it may be most appropriate to consider unbundling is when the accounting units are pollutant-specific, such as is the case with water quality and carbon markets.",NA,NA,"2013","UNIV CALIFORNIA  BERKELEY SCH LAW","2013","ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY","40","4","713","758",NA,"0046-1121","WOS:000330492400001","BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA","Article","BERKELEY",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gardner, Royal C. et al.

Measurements carried out at room temperature, and a range of relative humidity values (RH) from 0 to 70%, reflected real-world conditions similar to those of indoor air. Dry removal performance appeared to be dependent on the surface area of adsorbents and, for polar compounds, the relative hydrophobicity of the material. Performance of sorbents with hydrophilic surface chemistry, such as silica gel and molecular sieve 13X, decreased drastically with small increases in pre-exposed humidity. Activated charcoal and high-silica faujasite Y retained their capacities for toluene in relative humidities up to 50% and 70% respectively, with their selectivity for nonpolar species credited to hydrophobic pore structure and low water vapour uptake.

Much of the discourse surrounding extinction debts-the number of species that persist transiently following habitat loss, despite being headed for extinction-frames ultimate population crashes as the means of settling the debt. However, slow population decline also opens an opportunity to repay the debt by restoring habitat. The timing necessary for such habitat restoration to rescue a population from extinction has not been well studied. Here, we determine habitat restoration deadlines for a spatially implicit Levins/Tilman population model modified by an Allee effect. We find that restoration deadlines depend nonlinearly on initial, temporary, and final habitat destruction values. Conditions that hinder detection of an extinction debt also provide forgiving restoration timeframes. Our results highlight the importance of transient dynamics in restoration and suggest the beginnings of an analytic theory to understand outcomes of temporary press perturbations in a broad class of ecological systems.",NA,NA,"2019","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","2019 SEP","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","12","3","297","305","10.1007/s12080-018-0395-y","1874-1738 and 1874-1746","WOS:000485321800005","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Article","HEIDELBERG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Meyer, Katherine (2019) Extinction Debt Repayment via Timely Habitat Restoration. <i>Jour</i>.

In the case of plants, the effect of fragmentation or landscape context is still unclear and published results are divergent. One explanation for this divergence is the slow response of long-lived plants, creating an extinction debt. However, this has not been empirically confirmed. In this study, data were compiled from broad-scale studies of grasslands from throughout the world that relate plant diversity to fragmentation effects. Only seven studies from northern Europe, out of a total 61, gave any information on actual habitat fragmentation in time and space. In landscapes with > 10% grassland remaining, present-day species richness was related to past landscape or habitat pattern. In landscapes with < 10% grassland remaining, in contrast, plant species richness was more related to contemporary landscape or habitat pattern. Studies from landscapes with > 10% grassland remaining supported the concept of an extinction debt, while studies from more fragmented landscapes did not provide any evidence of an extinction debt.

In this Perspective, the authors explore the effects of time lags on biodiversity indicators using both theory and empirical data.Global conservation targets to reverse biodiversity declines and halt species extinctions are not being met despite decades of conservation action. However, a lack of measurable change in biodiversity indicators towards these targets is not necessarily a sign that conservation has failed; instead, temporal lags in species' responses to conservation action could be masking our ability to observe progress towards conservation success. Here we present our perspective on the influence of ecological time lags on the assessment of conservation success and review the principles of time lags and their ecological drivers. We illustrate how a number of conceptual species may respond to change in a theoretical landscape and evaluate how these responses might influence our interpretation of conservation success. We then investigate a time lag in a real biodiversity indicator using empirical data and explore alternative approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive time lags. Our proposal for setting and evaluating conservation targets is to use milestones, or interim targets linked to specific ecological mechanisms at key points in time, to assess whether conservation actions are likely to be working. Accounting for ecological time lags in biodiversity targets and indicators will greatly improve the way that we evaluate conservation successes.",NA,NA,"2020","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","2020 MAR","NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","4","3","304","311","10.1038/s41559-019-1087-8","2397-334X","WOS:000509654200001","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Watts, Kevin et al.

Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies limits our understanding of how patch dynamics affect biodiversity, especially when there is a time lag in species extinctions (extinction debt). We assessed how temporal changes in patch size, shape complexity and isolation affect populations of the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hypothesizing that we would find an extinction debt in this relatively long-lived species. We assessed patch occupancy, subpopulation size and immature-to-female ratio in 39 forest patches from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, in both 2001 and 2013. To identify time-lag responses to habitat disturbance, we related demographic attributes in 2013 to patch metrics in 2001 and 2013 and tested whether primate subpopulations were better predicted by current or historical patch characteristics. We also assessed how changes in patch metrics affected each demographic attribute between 2001 and 2013. Patch size and shape complexity increased over time, whereas isolation decreased. These positive spatial changes were accompanied by a 1.6-fold increase in mean subpopulation size over the same period. In addition, occupancy and immature-to-female ratio were similarly related to patch attributes in both years, suggesting that there is no extinction debt.

At a time of drastic decline of natural and seminatural grasslands, contemporary production forests provide various novel types of open spaces (clear-cuts, power line corridors, etc.) that are potentially suitable habitats for many grassland species, such as butterflies. On the other hand, grassland butterflies are known to perceive forest as a dispersal barrier, potentially limiting the utility of such alternative habitats. We evaluated the role of dispersal limitation in structuring local butterfly assemblages in conventionally managed forest landscapes in which clear-cutting generates varyingly isolated transient open habitats within the forest matrix. We compared butterfly species richness and composition in clear-cuts at opposite ends of a connectivity gradient: sites completely surrounded by forest (isolated clear-cuts) vs. sites connected to the network of other forest clearings by open corridors (non-isolated clear-cuts). We found only a slight difference in the species richness between isolated and non-isolated clear-cuts, both when all open-habitat species and when the subset of grassland species was compared. The frequencies of individual butterfly species in isolated and non-isolated sites were strongly correlated, regardless of their presumed dispersal ability. Our results indicate that, in large areas of production forests in Northern Europe, the formation of local butterfly assemblages is not significantly limited by dispersal.

By using different correlation tests and variable importance analysis, the results showed that spatial richness patterns for the three forest-dwelling terrestrial vertebrate groups had significant and stronger correlations with past forest cover area and other variables in the 1500 s, implying the evidence for extinction debts. Moreover, it was likely that the extinction debts have been partially paid, given that their global richness patterns were also significantly correlated with contemporary forest variables in the 2000 s (but the absolute magnitudes of the correlation coefficients were usually smaller than those calculated for historical forest variables). By utilizing species-area relationships, spatial extinction-debt magnitudes for the three vertebrate groups at the global scale were estimated and the hotspots of extinction debts were identified. These high-debt hotspots were generally situated in areas that did not spatially overlap with hotspots of species richness or high extinction-risk areas based on IUCN threatened status to a large extent.

Patches of four habitat types (rock outcrops, sand dunes, scrublands and forests) of different sizes and surrounding landscape compositions were selected along the coast of the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona (NE Spain). Attributes of habitat patches, historical (1956) and current landscape composition around them, land-cover changes (1956-2005) and other environmental and geographic factors within these patches were obtained. The association of these attributes with alien plant richness, abundance and composition was investigated using GLM and CCA. Alien species richness was mostly explained by patch size and shape and built-up area proportion from 1956 and 2005 in a 50 m buffer around patches. Alien species abundance was mostly related to patch shape, temperature, rainfall, land-cover changes within patches and cropland cover of 1956 in a 50 m buffer around patches. Alien species composition was primary related to habitat type, temperature, land-cover changes within patches and the composition of the surrounding landscape. Results suggest that landscape factors affect alien species richness and abundance differently, which are indicative of species colonization and spread, respectively. Landscape history positively affects both colonization and spread, with evidence for a colonization credit related with past urban cover, and the association between recent patch dynamics and present aliens spread. Results highlight the importance of including landscape structure and dynamics in the management of plant invasions in coastal Mediterranean habitats, especially in metropolitan regions.

These projections have been coupled with species-area relationships (SAR) to infer extinction rates indirectly as a result of the loss of climatically suitable areas and associated habitat. This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly, and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but unknown) delays-an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple bioclimatic envelope models of climate and habitat suitability with generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We show that (i) as many as four species of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full. Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years. We conclude that SAR approaches can provide useful advice to conservation on climate change impacts, provided there is a good understanding of the time lags over which delayed extinctions are likely to occur.",NA,NA,"2016","ROYAL SOC","2016 OCT 1","Biology letters","12","10",NA,NA,"10.1098/rsbl.2016.0236","1744-9561 and 1744-957X","WOS:000389636800003","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Fordham, Damien A. et al.

As most studies have been conducted in a context of habitat loss and fragmentation, we know very little about interaction assembly in new habitats from a landscape approach. This study aimed to test the effect of forest age and connectivity on acorn predation by a guild of predator insects differing in dispersal ability and resilience mechanisms: two weevils (Curculio elephas and C.glandium) and one moth (Cydia fagiglandana) in expanding Quercus ilex forests.Location: Barcelona, Spain.Methods: We assessed the proportion of infested acorns and identified the predator at the species level in five patches of connected old forests, connected new forests and isolated new forests. Effects of habitat age and connectivity at three scales (tree, patch and landscape) were analysed using generalized linear mixed-effects models.Results: Predation by weevils was positively associated with old connected forests, while moths, with better dispersal ability, were able to predate upon all patches equally. Moreover, C.elephas, the weevil with lower dispersal ability, exhibited colonization credits in the new isolated patches. In spite of these changes in the guild of seed predators, the proportion of infested acorns was non-significantly different among forests.Main conclusions: The guild of seed predators may vary depending on forest age and connectivity. However, because those with higher dispersal ability may replace less mobile species, this resulted in zero-sum effects of landscape attributes on acorn predation (i.e., similar predation rates in well-connected old forests vs. isolated new forests).",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 APR","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","24","4","521","534","10.1111/ddi.12701","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000427246300009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ruiz-Carbayo, Helena et al.

Although the term was first used in 1994 in the context of metapopulation models, its roots go back to general systems theory and the theory of island biogeography. It has been qualified and elaborated since 1994, mostly in terms of the effects of spatial pattern on the outcomes. The strongest critiques of the concept emphasize that the direct trade-off between competition and colonization abilities is not simple. The original application was to remnant habitat patches, but it could be applied to spatially heterogeneous habitats that are subject to climate change or invasive species.

Semi-natural grasslands are target habitats for ecological restoration in temperate Europe. Restoration of abandoned semi-natural grasslands often relies on spontaneous colonisation of plant species from the soil seed bank or the surrounding landscape. Although many studies show that the regional species pool is important for upholding local diversity, its effect on restoration outcome in semi-natural grasslands is poorly known. In this multi landscape study, we examined grassland specialist species occurring in restored grasslands and the effect of specialist species pool, landscape composition and local temporal factors. We found that specialist richness and frequency was positively affected by specialist richness and frequency in the surrounding landscape. Specialist richness in the restored grasslands also increased with time since restoration. Moreover, specialist frequency in the restored grassland increased with the proportion of semi-natural and remnant grassland habitats in the landscape. We also found a positive relationship between the proportion of species occurring in both the restored grassland and its surrounding landscape and time since restoration, in landscapes with high proportions of semi natural grasslands. This suggests that both temporal factors, as well as the landscape composition and species pool, affect plant recolonisation in restored semi-natural grasslands.",NA,NA,"2017","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2017 OCT","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","214",NA,"176","183","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.07.037","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","WOS:000412788100019","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Walden, Emelie et al.

J.","Extinction debt or habitat change? - Ongoing losses of woodland birds in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia","The loss, fragmentation and degradation of native vegetation are major causes of loss of biodiversity globally. Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species' declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species' decline in modified landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, fires and the addition of woody debris may also be required.

This trade-off implies that species ranked high in competitive ability will be ranked low with respect to dispersal. Although such a strict trade-off is plausible as a general trend, there are many examples in nature of deviations from perfect trade-offs. To determine how robust the ''extinction debt'' phenomenon is to imperfect trade-off relationships, I reexamined the extinction debt model of Tilman et al. in light of imperfect trade-offs. Numerically solving a system of differential equations, I found that, although the extinction debt phenomenon is not eliminated by the presence of imperfect trade-offs, the loss of species occurs earlier (with less habitat destruction) and more linearly than with perfect trade-offs.",NA,NA,"1997","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","1997 JUL","ECOLOGY","78","5","1597","1601",NA,"0012-9658","WOS:A1997XK92900029","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Banks, JE (1997) Do Imperfect Trade-Offs Affect the Extinction Debt Phenomenon? <i>Jour</i>.

The factors governing community assemblages in fragmented habitats remain a challenging topic in ecology, especially in the present context of global change. We studied the colonisation of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) woodland by specialist Lepidoptera in an afforested savannah-like landscape that has emerged as a result of the abandonment of croplands. We sampled herbivorous caterpillars for 5 years to assess the interplay between tree age and structure (canopy size and connectivity) on Lepidoptera species abundance, richness, diversity and composition.2. 1336 individuals belonging to 24 species of Lepidoptera were collected. Species abundance, richness and diversity increased in the best connected large trees and in the best connected young ones, probably because of the greater likelihood of colonisation and the existence of colonisation credits, respectively. Although species abundance, richness and diversity varied significantly between years in all trees, there were no effects for tree age, canopy size, or connectivity.3. Although tree age and structure had little effect on species composition (alpha and beta diversity), thereby revealing a predominant random effect, the relative abundance of Noctuids and Pyralids was significantly affected by tree age, suggesting that differences in dispersal abilities exist between these families.4. These findings suggest that habitat age and structural interactions play a significant role in the accumulation of Lepidoptera species but have little importance in determining their identities. From a conservation point of view, the results highlight the need to preserve old, large and well-connected holm oak trees in agricultural landscapes as refuges for specialist insects.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 JAN","INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY","10","1","21","31","10.1111/icad.12184","1752-458X and 1752-4598","WOS:000391945300003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ruiz-Carbayo, Helena et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Gibbs, David A. and Jiang, Lin","Environmental warming accelerates extinctions but does not alter extinction debt","Climate change is predicted to contribute to the present wave of extinctions; however, these extinctions may not immediately follow temperature increases and other climate change effects. We examined how predator species composition and increased temperatures affected bac terivorous protist community extinction debt (Mc number of species that will go extinct) and relaxation time (the amount of time it takes for the extinction debt to be paid oft). We found that neither affected relaxation time, but that the presence of a generalist predatory protist species increased extinction debt through its role as a keystone predator. Warming also significantly decreased how long it took communities to lose half of the species that were to eventually go extinct, That this half-relaxation time was shorter in warmed communities than in unwarmed communities in this system indicates that extinctions were front-loaded in the warmed communities compared to the unwarmed communities. Our findings suggest that even if increased temperature is not expected to increase extinction debt, it could still accelerate the rate at which those extinctions will occur. This in turn narrows the time window for taking actions to prevent a large portion of the extinction debt from being paid off. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft ffir Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbII.

"JOUR",NA,"Baldi, Andras and Voros, Judit","Extinction debt of Hungarian reserves: A historical perspective","We compiled species lists of the birds, reptiles and amphibians found in Hungarian reserves, and then used these to estimate the level of historical species richness using species-area relationships. The situation in the 18th century, before largescale land transformation, such as river regulations and drainages, could be approximately reconstructed. The species-area relationship was significant for all three classes. We estimated that 1 amphibian species, 4 reptile species, and 230 species of birds have become extinct in Hungary during the last two centuries. The latter seems unrealistic, so we evatuated extinctions in raptors (Fatconiformes) which was the best known taxon. According to our estimation, there should be 23 extinct species of raptors in Hungary. However, we found only 14 potential species, even when considering unlikely species. Therefore, we conclude that the present species richness pattern in the reserves may have not reached equilibrium for several taxa (tike birds), but probably has done so for others (amphibians and reptiles). Although, it would be desirable to extend the analysis to other taxa, this result indicates the existence of time-delayed species extinctions after habitat destruction, that is, an extinction debt. Currently, few studies have reported a timedelay effect from Europe. However, the results of this study suggest that an extinction debt may be important and should be considered when developing conservation strategies. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

O.","Does the seed bank contribute to the build-up of a genetic extinction debt in the grassland perennial Campanula rotundifolia?","Background and Aims Habitat fragmentation threatens global biodiversity. Many plant species persist in habitat fragments via persistent life cycle stages such as seed banks, generating a species extinction debt. Here, seed banks are hypothesized to cause a temporal delay in the expected loss of genetic variation, which can be referred to as a genetic extinction debt, as a possible mechanism behind species extinction debts.Methods Fragmented grassland populations of Campanula rotundifolia were examined for evidence of a genetic extinction debt, investigating if the seed bank contributed to the extinction debt build-up. The genetic make-up of 15 above-and below-ground populations was analysed in relation to historical and current levels of habitat fragmentation, both separately and combined.Key Results Genetic diversity was highest in above-ground populations, though below-ground populations contained 8 % of unique alleles that were absent above-ground. Above-ground genetic diversity and composition were related to historical patch size and connectivity, but not current patch characteristics, suggesting the presence of a genetic extinction debt in the above-ground populations. No such relationships were found for the belowground populations. Genetic diversity measures still showed a response to historical but not present landscape characteristics when combining genetic diversity of the above-and below-ground populations.Conclusions The fragmented C. rotundifolia populations exhibited a genetic extinction debt. However, the role of the seed banks in the build-up of this extinction debt is probably small, since the limited, unique genetic diversity of the seed bank alone seems unable to counter the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation on the population genetic structure of C. rotundifolia.",NA,NA,"2017","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","2017 SEP","ANNALS OF BOTANY","120","3","373","385","10.1093/aob/mcx057","0305-7364 and 1095-8290","WOS:000410236600007","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Plue, Jan et al.

Conservation banks are lands protected and managed for conservation of species of concern. Developers may purchase species credits from a conservation bank to offset adverse impacts of development at another site. Conservation banks facilitate pooling of mitigation resources from multiple development projects to protect planned habitat reserves of greater ecological value than can be achieved with project-by-project mitigation. In this study, we conducted the first ever assessment of the ecological performance of the California Conservation Banking Program. Specifically, we investigated to what extent conservation banks contribute to achieving regional conservation objectives. We hypothesized that conservation banks within a region should have similarly high ecological values if they are appropriately evaluated and prioritized based on principles of conservation planning. We created a new ecological value metric to evaluate and rank conservation banks and used it to compare potential conservation banks or reserves within a region. We found the ecological value of banks within regions varied and concluded that maximizing the ecological contribution of conservation banks requires prioritization of lands for potential bank sites and reserves. Our analysis identified circumstances where conservation banking is not an appropriate mitigation mechanism to protect rare species and natural communities. We concluded that limited funding for conservation planning should be directed toward regions where species of concern are wide-ranging, biodiversity is highly variable, threats to species of concern are highly varied, and there are many potential conservation bank sites.

"JOUR",NA,"Cousins, Sara A. O. and Vanhoenacker, Didrik","Detection of extinction debt depends on scale and specialisation","Many plants can persist in landscapes for a long time after focal habitats have disappeared or become fragmented, which might contribute to an extinction debt. Delayed responses of plant occurrence have recently received great attention, particularly in conservation, although evidence for extinction debts is incongruent. Here we asked if we could detect an extinction debt for plant species after 100 years of fragmentation, depending on regional or local (gamma or alpha respectively) diversity measure used, and if all plant species or only habitat specialists were investigated. Historical and contemporary grassland patterns were analysed in 33 rural landscapes (each 1 km(2) in diameter) in south-eastern Sweden. Results show that managed semi-natural grassland had declined from 39% to 3% in 100 years. Diversity measured at regional scale was best explained by grassland extent 100 years ago, for both all species and grassland specialists. Present-day management, but neither present nor past grassland extent, was important for grassland specialists' occurrence at the local scale, although present-day grassland proportion had a positive influence on species richness at the local scale. We found evidence of an extinction debt at both local and regional scale when all species were included in the analysis, but not for grassland specialist species at the local scale. However, the extinction debt is still to be settled for grassland specialists at the regional scale, and therefore the estimation of extinction debts in fragmented habitats presents one of the greatest challenges for conservation today and in the future.

In forest ecosystems, the influence of landscape history on contemporary biodiversity patterns has been shown to provide a convenient framework to explain shifts in plant assemblages. However, very few studies have controlled for present human-induced activities when analysing the effect of forest continuity on community structures. By cutting and removing trees, foresters substantially change stand ecological conditions, with consequences on biodiversity patterns. Disentangling the effect of past and present human activities on biodiversity is thus crucial for ecosystem management and conservation.2. We explored the response of plant and springtail species richness and composition to forest continuity (ancient vs. recent) in montane forests, while controlling for stand maturity (mature vs. overmature). We established 70 sites in landscapes dominated by unfragmented ancient forests where we surveyed plants and assessed springtails by analysing environmental DNA.3. Neither plant nor springtail species richness was influenced by forest continuity or by stand maturity. Instead, site-specific characteristics, especially soil properties and canopy openness, were of major importance in shaping above- and below-ground richness.4. For plant and springtail species composition, the effect of forest continuity was mediated by stand maturity. Thus, both plants and springtails showed a convergence in assemblage patterns with the increasing availability of overmature stand attributes. Moreover, soil and stand-scale factors were evidently more important than landscape-scale factors in shaping above- and below-ground species composition.5. Synthesis. We clearly demonstrated that biodiversity patterns are more strongly influenced by present human-induced activities than by past human-induced activities. In the Northern Alps where our study sites were located, the colonization credit of most species has been paid off and the transient biodiversity deficit usually related to forest continuity has moved towards equilibrium. These findings emphasize the necessity to better control for local-scale factors when analysing the response of biodiversity to forest continuity; we call for more research into the effects of forest continuity in unfragmented mountain forests.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JAN","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","106","1","306","318","10.1111/1365-2745.12808","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000417839700026","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Janssen, Philippe et al.

There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began.METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats.KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off.CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.",NA,NA,"2017","BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC","2017 JAN","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","104","1","182","189","10.3732/ajb.1600313","0002-9122 and 1537-2197","WOS:000394505200016","PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA","Article","ST LOUIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Niissalo, Matti A. et al.

In this study, we focus on one group of plants-native annuals-that are notably lacking in prairies today. Based on current and historical records, we compiled a list of 190 native herbaceous plant taxa (species, subspecies, and varieties) with high or moderate fidelity to prairie and oak habitats that have been recorded in upland prairies in the South Puget Sound region. Eighty (42%) of these are annuals, a proportion that is considerably higher than what occurs in these prairies today (average 18%). In addition, most native annuals (75) are forbs. These data suggest that in the past, native annual forbs may have comprised a significantly greater proportion of the diversity in the prairies. Although it is impossible to determine how widespread these species were historically, several measures suggest significant declines have occurred. Of the 80 total native annuals observed, 39% have not been recorded in recent inventories of the floras in any prairies in the region, and another 21% are known from only one site. Data from recently burned prairies suggest that both cover and species richness of annuals may double after a single fire. To avoid further loss of native annuals, we urge the inclusion of species from this functional group in future prairie restoration in this region.",NA,NA,"2014","NORTHWEST SCIENTIFIC ASSOC","2014 MAY","NORTHWEST SCIENCE","88","2","94","105","10.3955/046.088.0205","0029-344X and 2161-9859","WOS:000337219700002","JEFFREY DUDA, USGS, WESTERN FISHERIES RES CTR, 6505 NE 65 ST, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA","Article","SEATTLE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Dunwiddie, Peter W. et al.

Historically, in many cases, a narrow view may have allowed species declines to continue, virtually undetected, for long periods of time (perhaps even decades). We suggest that extinction debt is likely responsible for numerous (perhaps most) amphibian declines and that this perspective should be incorporated into the structure of amphibian research and management. Extinction debt, originally proposed to explain changes in species richness following environmental disturbance, also may refer to the proportion of populations of an individual species that is expected to eventually be lost because of habitat change. A conservation framework to address extinction debt focuses research on threats at the individual, population, and metapopulation levels. This approach will help enhance, restore, and protect specific processes and habitats at the proper scale by directing management to the most vulnerable level and stage of a species. We illustrate this approach using Flatwoods Salamanders, Ambystoma cingulatum and Ambystoma bishopi, which occurred historically throughout the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States but have experienced a greater than 85% loss of populations in recent years. Reversal of these losses is possible only if conservation and recovery efforts encompass individual, population, and metapopulation levels. We illustrate our framework by outlining actions that could be taken at each of these levels to help guide conservation and management of amphibians with complex life cycles and provide options for how to prioritize conservation actions in the face of logistical and budgetary shortfalls.",NA,NA,"2017","SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES","2017 MAR","JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY","51","1","12","18","10.1670/16-090","0022-1511 and 1937-2418","WOS:000393797600003","C/O ROBERT D ALDRIDGE, ST LOUIS UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 3507 LACLEDE, ST LOUIS, MO 63103 USA","Article","ST LOUIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Semlitsch, Raymond D. et al.

Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterfly species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classified butterfly species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found significant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more significant impacts in small patches than in large ones.

The extinction debt will affect the interpretation of ongoing impacts and extinctions, because little is understood about the changes in species abundance through time in remnants following surrounding habitat destruction. In some models, thresholds in mean time to extinction are sensitive to the spatial configuration of the remnants, but changes in abundance through time could also be affected. A simulation that includes hierarchical competition, reproduction, dispersal, and mortality was run on two-phase landscapes varying in spatial pattern and extent of habitat destruction. In this article, the courses of temporal change in species abundance, or trajectories, are examined. Thresholds are not evident among different amounts of extant habitat or across a range of spatial patterns. Instead, trends exist in the amount of impact per unit reduction in habitat. Better competitors are more sensitive to the initial stage of destruction and to destruction leaving a more dispersed pattern of habitat; better colonizers have the opposite trends. Assessment of cumulative impacts will vary with species in the initial and penultimate stages of habitat destruction.

"JOUR",NA,"Loehle, C and Li, BL","Habitat destruction and the extinction debt revisited","A very important published analysis of the problem of habitat destruction (Tilman et al. 1994 [Nature 371:65-66]) concluded that such destruction may lead to an extinction debt, which is the irreversible, preferential loss of competitive species following a prolonged transient or delay after the habitat destruction. We analyzed this model using analytic and simulation techniques. Relating this analytic model to real-world situations shows that it applies to scattered permanent devegetation of small patches and to across-the-board decreases in fecundity such as could be caused by pollution. For repeated spatially random disturbance, we develop a new model that shows an even more severe extinction-debt effect. For larger fragments of remnant vegetation, such as forest woodlots, we argue that the assumptions of-the model are violated but that an extinction debt nevertheless occurs due to gradual stochastic elimination of species that are very rare and isolated in these fragments. For habitat destruction on regional scales (reduction in ecosystem area without disturbance in remnant areas), one must, in contrast, apply species-area relations based on the distribution of-different habitat types (e.g., elevational and rainfall gradients, physiographic and edaphic variability). Such an analysis predicts rapid, not delayed, loss of all types of species, not just competitive types. We conclude that the extinction-debt effect is real and arises in three different models, but relating the models to real-world conservation problems must be done with care.",NA,NA,"1996","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","1996 AUG","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","6","3","784","789","10.2307/2269483","1051-0761","WOS:A1996UZ41200024","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loehle, C et al.

Habitat loss, fragmentation and transformation threaten the persistence of many species worldwide. Population and individual fitness are often compromised in small, degraded and isolated habitats, but extinction can be a slow process and extinction debts are common. 2. Long-lived species are prone to persist as remnant populations in low quality habitats for a long time, but the population and individual-level mechanisms of extinction debt remain poorly explored so far. 3. We here investigate the mechanisms involved in the long-term persistence of the common grassland specialist, long-lived, clonal plant Aphyllanthes monspeliensis L. (Asparagaceae). after forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean calcareous grasslands in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). For this purpose we assess vegetative (aboveground and belowground) and reproductive plant performance indicators and their habitat and landscape (current and historical) drivers. 4. We confirm the existence of an extinction debt for this species, since current plant frequency is related to historical but not current connectivity, and we also find a positive effect of historical connectivity on seed set. In addition, current tree cover negatively affects individual size and aboveground/belowground biomass ratio, and biotic soil acidification leads to a reduction in the flowering probability of individuals and stems. 5. However, we also find that current connectivity negatively affects flowering and that tree cover enhances seed set. The forestation process, thus, also exerts a positive effect on some fitness traits, probably by providing a moister environment. 6. Synthesis. Habitat loss and deterioration result in a decreased vegetative performance of Aphyllanthes monspeliensis, a grassland specialist, but show contrasting effects on its reproductive performance. However, further forest encroachment would increase light competition and soil acidification, threatening its persistence and promoting the payment of the extinction debt if no conservation measures are taken.

However, previous studies have not tried to detect the presence of an extinction debt from individual species loss and colonization rates in an assemblage of plant species. In addition, few researchers have studied extinction debt using factors other than landscape changes [e.g. the impacts of management (mowing or burning), habitat use by large herbivores or climate factors]. In the present study, we examined an extinction debt for vascular plant species by monitoring their survival and colonization dynamics.Location: Abandoned and managed semi-natural grasslands, central Japan, where the area of grasslands has decreased considerably.Methods: We re-surveyed species compositions in the 2000s in plots that had been surveyed in the 1980s, and estimated the impacts of the past (1910s) and recent (1980s-2000s) proportion of the total grassland area and the above-mentioned factors on species dynamics during the past 20yrs using hierarchical Bayesian models.Results: In abandoned grasslands, the past grassland proportion was significantly positively associated with the probabilities of survival of 96% of the grassland specialists and of colonization by 21% of these specialists. The effects of the past grassland proportion on the specialists were much stronger than those of recent grassland proportion and the other factors studied (i.e. herbivores, climate). In managed grasslands, however, the past grassland proportion had little effect on survival of and colonization by specialists from the result that few specialists were significantly affected by past grassland proportion.Conclusions: We found higher probabilities of both survival of and colonization by grassland specialists at sites with larger past habitat areas, which suggests that there is a time lag after habitat loss before the loss of specialists.

Quantifying such extinctions and investigating long-term consequences of perturbations has proven challenging, because perturbations are not isolated and occur across various spatial and temporal scales, from local habitat losses to global warming. Additionally, the relative importance of eco-evolutionary processes varies across scales, because levels of ecological organization, i.e. individuals, (meta)populations and (meta)communities, respond hierarchically to perturbations. To summarize our current knowledge of the scales and mechanisms influencing extinction debts, we reviewed recent empirical, theoretical and methodological studies addressing either the spatio-temporal scales of extinction debts or the eco-evolutionary mechanisms delaying extinctions. Extinction debts were detected across a range of ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with estimates ranging from 9 to 90% of current species richness. The duration over which debts have been sustained varies from 5 to 570 yr, and projections of the total period required to settle a debt can extend to 1000 yr. Reported causes of delayed extinctions are 1) life-history traits that prolong individual survival, and 2) population and metapopulation dynamics that maintain populations under deteriorated conditions. Other potential factors that may extend survival time such as microevolutionary dynamics, or delayed extinctions of interaction partners, have rarely been analyzed. Therefore, we propose a roadmap for future research with three key avenues: 1) the microevolutionary dynamics of extinction processes, 2) the disjunctive loss of interacting species and 3) the impact of multiple regimes of perturbation on the payment of debts. For their ability to integrate processes occurring at different levels of ecological organization, we highlight mechanistic simulation models as tools to address these knowledge gaps and to deepen our understanding of extinction dynamics.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 DEC","ECOGRAPHY","42","12","1973","1990","10.1111/ecog.04740","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000501362200001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Figueiredo, Ludmilla et al.

It can create temporal lags in decline of species in relation to destruction of habitat coverage. Plant species specialized in semi-natural grasslands, especially meadows, often express such extinction debt.ObjectivesWe studied habitat loss and fragmentation of meadows and examined whether the changes in meadow coverage had caused an extinction debt on vascular plants. We also studied whether historical or present landscape patterns or contemporary environmental factors were more important determinants of species occurrence.MethodsWe surveyed the plant species assemblages of 12 grazed and 12 mown meadows in Central Finland and detected the meadow coverages from their surroundings on two spatial scales and on three time steps. We modelled the effects of functional connectivity, habitat amount, and isolation on species richness and community composition.ResultsWe observed drastic and dynamic meadow loss in landscapes surrounding our study sites during the last 150years. However, we did not find explicit evidence for an extinction debt in meadow plants. The observed species richness correlated with contemporary factors, whereas both contemporary factors and habitat availability during the 1960s affected community composition.ConclusionsEffective conservation management of meadow biodiversity builds on accurate understanding of the relative importance of past and present factors on species assemblages.

Within this context, the 'extinction debt' hypothesis brings into question an often assumed relationship between species richness and present-day spatial habitat structure (i.e. extent, fragmentation), suggesting instead that the richness and composition of biological communities may lag behind spatial changes in habitat. We examined evidence for an extinction debt among epiphytic lichens, a highly diverse biological group of significant conservation concern. Using sites in Scotland, we compared epiphyte species richness in smaller-scale habitat units (aspen stands) to larger-scale woodland structure (extent and fragmentation) measured at two spatial scales (1 km(2) and 4 km(2)) and for two timeframes, modern (1990s to 2000s) and historic (1860s to 1880s). Species richness was positively related to woodland extent and negatively related to woodland fragmentation; however, richness was explained better by historic woodland structure at a 1-km(2) scale, than by modern woodland structure. The results indicate: (1) a coupling of stand-scale epiphyte assembly and dynamics of the wider woodland ecosystem, and (2) a significant lag in the response of epiphyte species richness to habitat spatial structure. However, the effect of spatial habitat structure is different between species groups with contrasting traits. The effect of decreasing woodland extent on epiphyte richness is generally more severe for microlichens (comprising a greater number of rare and specialist species) than the more generalist macrolichens.",NA,NA,"2007","WILEY","2007 JAN","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","13","1","84","91","10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00310.x","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000243403000009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ellis, Christopher J. et al.

EDT posits that in a closed system with a mix of competitor and colonizer species and experiencing habitat fragmentation and loss, the competitor species will show a gradual decline in fitness (occupancy) eventually leading to their extinction (extirpation) over multiple generations. A corollary of this is a colonizer credit, where colonizer species occupancy may increase with fragmentation because the disturbance gives that life history a transient relative competitive advantage. We found that competitor species occupancy decreased in time concomitant with an increase in occupancy of colonizer species and this may be related to habitat fragmentation or loss owing to industrialized bottom trawl fishing. Mean species richness increased over time which suggests less specialization (decreased dominance) of the assemblage that may result from habitat homogenization. These analyses also showed that when abundance of species was decreased by fishing but eventually returned to previous levels, on average it had a lower occupancy than earlier in the series which could increase their vulnerability to depletion by fishing. Changing occupancy and diversity patterns of the community over time is consistent with EDT which can be exacerbated by direct impacts of fishery removals as well as climate change impacts on the fish community assemblage.",NA,NA,"2016","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2016 NOV 28","PLOS ONE","11","11",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0166409","1932-6203","WOS:000389472400024","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Article","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Duplisea, Daniel E. et al.

"DATA",NA,"Nomoto, Hanna and Alexander, Jake","Dataset: Drivers of local extinction risk in alpine plants under warming climate","The scarcity of local plant extinctions following recent climate change has been explained by demographic inertia and lags in the displacement of resident species by novel species, generating an extinction debt. We established a transplant experiment to disentangle the contribution of these processes to local extinction risk of four alpine plants in the Swiss Alps. Projected population growth (lambda) derived from integral projection models was reduced by 0.07/Â°C of warming on average, while novel species additionally decreased lambda by 0.15 across warming levels. Effects of novel species on predicted extinction time were greatest at warming <2Â°C for two species. Projected population declines under both warming and with novel species were primarily driven by increased mortality. Our results suggest that extinction debt can be explained by a combination of demographic inertia and lags in novel species establishment, with the latter being particularly important for some species under low levels of warming.

However, both the short- and the long-term effects of contrasting LULC change pathways on this assembly are seldom explored. Objectives To assess how LULC change pathways affect woody plant community parameters (i.e. species richness, diversity and evenness) and species' presence and abundance, compared with environmental factors and neutral processes. Methods The study was performed in Mediterranean limestone scrublands in NE Spain. Cover of each woody species was recorded in 150 scrubland plots belonging to five LULC change pathways along the past century, identified using land-cover maps and fieldwork. For each plot, total woody and herbaceous vegetation cover, local environmental variables and geographical position were recorded. Effects of these pathways and factors on plant community parameters and on species presence and abundance were assessed, considering spatial effects potentially associated to neutral processes. Results Species richness and diversity were associated with LULC change pathways and elevation, while evenness was only associated with this last. Pathways and environmental variables explained similar variance in both species' presence and cover. In general, while community parameters were affected by recent-past (1956) use, species presence and abundance were associated with far-past (pre-1900) cropping. No relevant spatial effect was detected for any studied factor. Conclusions Historical LULC changes and current environmental factors drive local-scale community assembly in Mediterranean scrublands to an equal extent, while contrasting time-scale effects are found at community and species level.

"JOUR",NA,"Loeffler, Franz and Poniatowski, Dominik and Fartmann, Thomas","Extinction debt across three taxa in well-connected calcareous grasslands","The biodiversity in calcareous grasslands suffered from severe habitat loss due to land-use intensification and abandonment across Europe. Although these grasslands are now protected under the EU Habitats Directive, many species in the remaining habitat patches are still declining. Recent studies suggest that species across different taxa may become extinct with a substantial time delay, even without further habitat loss. Consequently, there might be an extinction debt, which poses a major challenge for conservation. Here, we analysed the response of plant, grasshopper and butterfly species richness in calcareous grasslands to habitat fragmentation over the last five decades. In this study, habitat area and connectivity have undergone a marked decline between 1970 and 1990 but have only slightly declined during the last three decades. Despite this, the current richness of specialist and generalist species among plants and butterflies was equally or better explained by past than present landscape conditions. This finding indicates the existence of an extinction debt in both taxa in the still well-connected grasslands of the study area. We conclude that increased conservation measures since the 1990s have favoured species persistence, despite severe habitat loss in the more distant past. By contrast, grasshopper diversity weakly responded to habitat area and connectivity; rather it is likely to depend mainly on habitat quality. To inhibit future extinctions, it is crucial to maintain large-scale patches by traditional land-use practices (i.e. rough grazing or mowing once a year), as well as restore former habitat to facilitate species dispersal in fragmented landscapes.",NA,NA,"2020","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2020 JUN","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","246",NA,"108588","108588","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108588","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","ZOOREC:ZOOR15608056060","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loeffler, Franz et al.

In highly fragmented environments, this phenomenon often causes extinction debts. However, few studies have been carried out in urban settings.To determine if there are time lags in the response of temperate natural grasslands to urbanization. Does it differ for indigenous species and for species indicative of disturbance and between woody and open grasslands? Do these time lags change over time? What are the potential landscape factors driving these changes? What are the corresponding vegetation changes?In 1995 and 2012 vegetation sampling was carried out in 43 urban grassland sites.

We used generalized linear models and model selection to determine which time period best predicted the contemporary species richness patterns.Woody grasslands showed time lags of 20-40 years. Contemporary open grassland communities were, generally, associated with more contemporary landscapes. Altitude and road network density of natural areas were the most frequent predictors of species richness. The importance of the predictors changed between the different models.

"JOUR",NA,"Sbordoni, Valerio","Genetic and ecological facets of the decline of populations in butterflies and other insects","The theme of populations and species decline and extinction in the wild is day by day more alive and of dramatic topicality, and involves insects like all the others organisms living on our small planet. In this talk, I have tried to summarize some general aspects dealing with the extinction vortex paradigm, with some examples from captive breeding in aquaculture and wild populations of insects and other taxa taken from literature and my personal experience. Namely, I focused on a couple of study cases of Lepidopteran populations in nature: the day flying moth Zygaena ephialtes in the Fioio valley, within the Regional Natural Park of Monti Simbruini, and the Italian endemic butterfly Hipparchia sbordonii restricted to the Ponziane islands. In both these examples, the ecological determinants of population decline and the genetic signs supporting a reduction of heterozygosis are discussed. In both cases, yet at much higher extent in H. sbordonii, the landscape changes seem to be have affected the effective population size and the population fitness. Finally, I address to a novel approach attempting to explore the extinction/colonization dynamics of insect communities on Italian alpine islands, i.e. higher elevation areas with unique biological communities surrounded by an ""ocean"" of unsuitable lands. During the Holocene (the last 11,000 years), islands' boundaries experienced repeated altitudinal fluctuations due to changes in climate conditions. Consequently, islands' areas were subject to variations of different intensity and alterations in inter-island connectivity. As a function of both the original area and the elevational composition (i.e. highlands vs. mountain peaks), during the warmer phases some islands reduced strongly or disappeared, causing the partial or complete extinction of the local biota while the subsequent cooling allowed a new rise and expansion of these islands. Based on the analysis of a massive dataset including montane species of butterflies, Orthoptera and three Coleoptera families characterized by poor vs. high dispersal ability, and a millennial scaling of island size and interconnectivity, Silvio Marta et al. run two sets of generalized linear models (GLMs) considering the number of species as a function of present and past island geography. The results helped to understand to what extent the local extinctions and the subsequent immigration credit were responsible in shaping the current insect communities of Alpine and Apennine mountain islands.",NA,NA,"2018",NA,"2018","Atti della Accademia Nazionale Italiana di Entomologia Rendiconti","66",NA,"159","168",NA,"0065-0757","ZOOREC:ZOOR15507044346",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Sbordoni, Valerio (2018) Genetic and Ecological Facets of the Decline of Populations in Butterflies and Other Insects. <i>Jour</i>.

"JOUR",NA,"Ibbe, Mathias and Milberg, Per and Tuner, Albert and Bergman, Karl-Olof","History matters: Impact of historical land use on butterfly diversity in clear-cuts in a boreal landscape","In Swedish boreal landscapes, the loss of species-rich semi-natural grasslands is largely due to a long history of agricultural abandonment. Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe.The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The results of this study have implications for forest management practices. Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of habitats for butterflies and other organisms.

While ephedrine has not been isolated from any of the extracts of No. American species, pharmacological experiments indicate that it, or closely related substances, is present in appreciable amounts. A translation of Stapf's diagnosis [1899] covering sections and tribes is provided. Valid species now number more than 40. These are listed alphabetically, with citations to original descriptions, tribal classification, and distributional areas. A phylogenetic key covering No. American species is presented, with full citations to literature, description, type locality, and range of each of the 10 included species. The 40 odd species credited to the genus are about equally divided between Asia and America; 4 or 5 species are known from Central Asia, and at least 3 from India. China is represented by 5 species, but Ephedra vulgaris Rich. var. helvetica H. & T., currently associated with the name ""Ma huang,"" is not a valid name. Stapf (1927) has described a new species, Ephedra sinica, as ""Ma huang,"" of Chili Province, but it is questionable whether name is strictly applicable to any one species. In western Asia these are 8 species, in Europe 2, in Africa 3, and in Australia 1; 12 species are recorded from So. America, but these should doubtless be reduced to 8 or 10. It is safe to assume that a number of species and varieties will be found to yield different qualities and quantities of physiologically active substances. The following factors rnust be carefully considered in taxonomic-physiological studies: value of young versus fully matured growth; seasons of harvesting; relative merit of different parts of the plant (roots, joints, stems, fruits, and seeds); and the effect of ecological influences (altitude, temp. soil, rainfall). Chinese differentiate clearly between action of roots and stems, and the different portions of the same plant may be found to yield different chemical principles. The immediate practical problem is to ascertain the nature and quantity of physiologically active substances in the various species and varieties of Ephedra, and to correlate these data with morphological and ecological variations. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: (G.

"JOUR",NA,"Ellis, Christopher J. and Coppins, Brian J.","Quantifying the role of multiple landscape-scale drivers controlling epiphyte composition and richness in a conservation priority habitat (juniper scrub)","Recent concern over human-induced climate warming has activated bioclimatic research projecting the species-response to climate change scenarios. However, climate change is one of a range of human-induced environmental drivers controlling biodiversity, and for many species should be considered together within a framework of relevant stresses and threats. This paper critically assesses the sensitivity of epiphyte assemblages to regional gradients in climate, Pollution regime and landscape-scale habitat structure (woodland extent and fragmentation). We examine lichen epiphytes associated with juniper scrub (a conservation priority habitat in Europe), sampled across a network of protected sites in Britain (Special Areas of Conservation). Results point to significant differences in associated epiphyte diversity between conservation priority sites. Historic woodland structure was identified as of greater importance than present-day woodland structure in controlling species composition and richness, pointing to an extinction debt among lichen epiphytes. Climatic setting was important in controlling species composition, but not species richness. However. we demonstrate that pollution regime exerts the dominant controlling force for epiphyte assemblages across regional gradients. As a corollary, we caution that for many species groups - for example those sensitive to pollutants, or landscape structure - an exclusive focus on climate is restricting, and that climate change models should expand to include a range of multiple interacting factors.

"JOUR",NA,"Adriaens, Dries and Honnay, Olivier and Hermy, Martin","No evidence of a plant extinction debt in highly fragmented calcareous grasslands in Belgium","Long transient times in response to decreasing habitat area and increasing isolation may cause the present plant species distribution to reflect the historical rather than the present landscape configuration, resulting in a so-called extinction debt. To investigate how plant species richness is shaped by both present and historical landscape configuration and local environmental conditions in fragmented calcareous grasslands, 64 sites in Southern Belgium were surveyed for their total species richness and environmental characteristics. Species were subdivided in specialist and generalist groups and the former were clustered into emergent groups (EGs) according to 16 relevant life-history traits. Four specialist emergent groups were derived: orchids, rosette species, annuals and half-rosette species. Both specialist and generalist species richness increased with present fragment area, while present fragment connectivity only affected the number of specialist species. This trend was maintained for most EGs, although habitat area was mostly more important than connectivity. All species groups responded to an insolation gradient, except EGs of rosette and annual species. Differential response to fragmentation among emergent groups could be interpreted in terms of dispersal and persistence traits. No relation between species richness and historical area or connectivity was found, making an extinction debt unlikely. Hence, present-day variation in plant species diversity seems to be no legacy of past landscape configuration. Our results clearly indicate that plant species may be quickly lost in response to new fragmentation events. To restore plant diversity, management should focus both on mitigating landscape fragmentation and restoring habitat quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"JOUR",NA,"Koyanagi, Tomoyo F. and Furukawa, Takuya and Osawa, Takeshi","Nestedness-resultant community disassembly process of extinction debt in a highly fragmented semi-natural grassland","There are two major processes of species disassembly after landscape changes: non-random loss of species resulting in nested assemblages and species replacement resulting in spatial species turnover. Although time-lagged responses of species to landscape change have been widely recognized, few studies have empirically evaluated which of these two processes is more closely related to extinction debt (i.e., postponed species extinction following habitat loss). This study aimed to understand the underlying processes of extinction debt by partitioning beta-diversity into components of species nestedness and species turnover. We measured grassland species richness at three spatial extents in a highly fragmented semi-natural grassland landscape in Japan. Dissimilarity-based beta-diversity was partitioned into two components (i.e., nestedness-resultant dissimilarity [beta (sne)] and turnover-resultant dissimilarity [beta (sim)]), which were further analyzed using principal coordinates analyses (PCoA). The relationships between the variability of PCoA axis 1 scores and the current and past habitat proportions were evaluated. A significant positive relationship between current grassland species richness and past (i.e., the 1910s) grassland proportion was found at the largest spatial extent.

We evaluated whether habitat suitability models can be used in conjunction with species-area relationships (SAR) to detect apparent extinction debts as implicated by the conservation status assigned to bird species.LocationKwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.MethodsWe modelled historic distributions of coastal forests using MaxEnt, a presence-only technique for modelling species distributions. The model provided an estimate of forest loss. We then conducted 293 point counts to survey birds within remaining forest fragments and employed an information-theoretic framework to test for the best fit SAR model. Extinction debts were calculated using the estimate of forest loss and the empirical SAR data.ResultsOur model suggests extensive forest loss (82%) within a naturally fragmented landscape. The power function provided the best fit for bird SAR. Fourteen bird species are predicted to go extinct from coastal forests. Predicted extinctions closely matched the number of threatened species locally but not globally. Predicted extinctions also only matched globally threatened species that reach their northernmost distribution limit within coastal forests, but not species that reach their southernmost distribution limit here.Main conclusionsWe found that habitat suitability models could be used in conjunction with SAR to estimate extinction debt implied by conservation statuses of extant species. Our approach assumed that forest loss drives extinction debts but also provided the opportunity to link forest loss and the likelihood of extinction. Models of historical forest distribution may provide guidelines of where to implement restoration actions. Maintaining matrix habitats that link forest fragments and targeted landscape level restoration that increases fragment area and link isolated fragments will be important to prevent predicted extinctions.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 NOV","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","19","11","1353","1365","10.1111/ddi.12099","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000325542600002","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Olivier, Pieter I. et al.

This study identifies which woodland-dependent species are still declining in two different habitats, Pink Gum-Blue Gum woodland and Stringybark woodland. Weanalyse the Mount Lofty Ranges Woodland Bird Long-Term Monitoring Dataset for 1999-2007, to look for changes in abundance of 59 species. Weuse logistic regression of prevalence on lists in a Bayesian framework, and List Length Analysis to control for variation in detectability. Compared with Reporting Rate Analysis, a more traditional approach, List Length Analysis provides tighter confidence intervals by accounting for changing detectability. Several common species were declining significantly. Increasers were generally large-bodied generalists. Many birds have already disappeared from this modified and naturally isolated woodland island, and our results suggest that more specialist insectivores are likely to follow. The Mount Lofty Ranges can be regarded as a 'canary landscape' for temperate woodlands elsewhere in Australia-without immediate action their bird communities are likely to follow the trajectory of the Mount Lofty Ranges avifauna.

We propose an options approach to allocating scarce conservation funds that explicitly allows for the irreversibility of investment and risks to investment payoffs. The approach captures ecosystem dynamics from extinction debt, as well as ecological and climatic risks at the project scale. Climatic risks are introduced through three channels: the effects of climate change on species loss, future rehabilitation benefits and frequency of catastrophic events. Our results suggest that allocating voluntary rehabilitation contracts on the basis of real options criteria increases cost-efficiency and delivers greater value for money for the Government when compared with the conventional cost-effectiveness criterion as it is illustrated for the case of Box Gum Grassy Woodland rehabilitation in Australia.

Although local habitat history can modulate the existence of extinction debt (i.e., the number of populations predicted to become extinct) in a landscape, its role in detecting extinction debt has not been examined explicitly. We aimed to compare the detectability of extinction debt among populations of an endangered semi-natural grassland species, Echinops setifer (Compositae), in the grassland landscape of Mt. Aso, Japan. We classified populations into three groups that differed in local habitat history: stable (habitat loss ae<currency>30% since the 1930s), moderately decreased (30% < loss ae<currency> 90%), and severely decreased (loss > 90%). We then evaluated whether the effects of habitat areas during the 1930s and 2000s varied among groups to explain population size by GLMMs and estimated coefficient of explanatory variable by Bayesian MCMC methods. Within the groups, stable group showed significant positive relationships with both past and current habitat areas. The moderately decreased group only showed significant positive relationships with past habitat areas, indicating the existence of extinction debt in these populations. The severely decreased group only showed significant positive relationships with current habitat areas, indicating that they may have already paid their extinction debt because the rate of grassland loss exceeded the extinction threshold. Even within the same landscape, extinction debt varied in response to local habitat history. In spatially heterogeneous landscapes, evaluation of effects of local habitat history can elucidate the habitat-based extinction risks for plant populations.",NA,NA,"2017","SPRINGER","2017 JUN","PLANT ECOLOGY","218","6","725","735","10.1007/s11258-017-0724-z","1385-0237 and 1573-5052","WOS:000401435100008","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Koyanagi, Tomoyo F. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Kolk, Jens and Naaf, Tobias","Herb layer extinction debt in highly fragmented temperate forests - Completely paid after 160 years?","The time-delayed extinction of plant species following habitat fragmentation is a well-known phenomenon in ecology. The length of the relaxation time until this 'extinction debt' is paid (i.e., until extinctions cease) depends on the ecosystem, species group and extent of fragmentation. Studies of grassland ecosystems have revealed that plant extirpations after fragmentation can occur rapidly when the degree of fragmentation is high. Studies of extinction debt in highly fragmented forests, however, are lacking. In this study, we evaluated the existence of an extinction debt in the Prignitz, Brandenburg, Germany, where 94% of the semi-natural forests have vanished since 1780. We surveyed the herb-layer species of 104 forest patches and fitted species richness as a function of the historical and present-day patch configurations. Models including the present-day habitat area and connectivity explained the present day species richness better than models including historical patch-configuration variables. There was no significant effect of the historical habitat area on the present day species richness. However, the effect of historical patch connectivity on the richness of forest specialists with short-distance dispersal potential was significant when excluding present-day habitat area from the models and habitat quality and heterogeneity were used as covariables. The extinction debt has largely been paid after approximately 160 years of relaxation time which contrasts with previous studies of temperate forests that have found extinction debts persisting 120-225 years after fragmentation. We demonstrate that extinction debts in temperate forests may be paid off more rapidly if the degree of fragmentation is high. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated how ac.a.30-year (1985-2017) historical trajectory of native vegetation loss affected fish communities in 47 streams of southern Brazilian grasslands. We tested whether current species richness and composition would be more related to past or to recent natural vegetation cover. We then defined trajectories of vegetation loss and tested whether different attributes (frequency, magnitude and duration of disturbance) affected particular species and functional groups. We found that current species richness and composition were more related to past than to current vegetation cover. However, we also observed that responses of particular species and functional groups were dependent on specific trajectory attributes. We concluded that present fish community characteristics may respond not only to past watershed conditions but also to how watershed conditions have changed over the time.

"JOUR",NA,"Mouquet, Nicolas and Matthiessen, Birte and Miller, Tom and Gonzalez, Andrew","Extinction Debt in Source-Sink Metacommunities","In an increasingly modified world, understanding and predicting the consequences of landscape alteration on biodiversity is a challenge for ecologists. To this end, metacommunity theory has developed to better understand the complexity of local and regional interactions that occur across larger landscapes. While metacommunity ecology has now provided several alternative models of species coexistence at different spatial scales, predictions regarding the consequences of landscape alteration have been done exclusively for the competition-colonization trade off model (CC). In this paper we investigate the effects of landscape perturbation on source-sink metacommunities. We show that habitat destruction perturbs the equilibria among species competitive effects within the metacommunity, driving both direct extinctions and an indirect extinction debt. As in CC models, we found a time lag for extinction following habitat destruction that varied in length depending upon the relative importance of direct and indirect effects. However, in contrast to CC models, we found that the less competitive species are more affected by habitat destruction. The best competitors can sometimes even be positively affected by habitat destruction, which corresponds well with the results of field studies. Our results are complementary to those results found in CC models of metacommunity dynamics. From a conservation perspective, our results illustrate that landscape alteration jeopardizes species coexistence in patchy landscapes through complex indirect effects and delayed extinctions patterns.",NA,NA,"2011","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2011 MAR 8","PLOS ONE","6","3",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0017567","1932-6203","DRCI:DATA2013082003639958","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Data study","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mouquet, Nicolas et al.

The study of epiphytes could improve understanding of biological responses to climatic changes, but only if the conditions that elicit physiological performance changes are clearly defined.METHODS: We evaluated individual growth performance of the epiphytic lichen Evernia mesomorpha, an iconic boreal forest indicator species, in the first year of a decade-long experiment featuring whole-ecosystem warming and drying. Field experimental enclosures were located near the southern edge of the species' range.KEY RESULTS: Mean annual biomass growth of Evernia significantly declined 6 percentage points for every + 1 degrees C of experimental warming after accounting for interactions with atmospheric drying. Mean annual biomass growth was 14% in ambient treatments, 2% in unheated control treatments, and -9% to -19% (decreases) in energy-added treatments ranging from +2.25 to +9.00 degrees C above ambient temperatures. Warming-induced biomass losses among persistent individuals were suggestive evidence of an extinction debt that could precede further local mortality events.CONCLUSIONS: Changing patterns of warming and drying would decrease or reverse Evernia growth at its southern range margins, with potential consequences for the maintenance of local and regional populations. Negative carbon balances among persisting individuals could physiologically commit these epiphytes to local extinction. Our findings illuminate the processes underlying local extinctions of epiphytes and suggest broader consequences for range shrinkage if dispersal and recruitment rates cannot keep pace.",NA,NA,"2018","BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC","2018 FEB","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","105","2","266","274","10.1002/ajb2.1022","0002-9122 and 1537-2197","WOS:000428335200016","PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA","Article","ST LOUIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Smith, Robert J. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Heiniger, Charlene and Barot, Sebastien and Ponge, Jean-Francois and Salmon, Sandrine and Botton-Divet, Leo and Carmignac, David and Dubs, Florence","Effect of habitat spatiotemporal structure on collembolan diversity","Landscape fragmentation is a major threat to biodiversity. It results in the transformation of continuous (hence large) habitat patches into isolated (hence smaller) patches, embedded in a matrix of another habitat type. Many populations are harmed by fragmentation because remnant patches do not fulfil their ecological and demographic requirements. In turn, this leads to a loss of biodiversity, especially if species have poor dispersal abilities. Moreover, landscape fragmentation is a dynamic process in which patches can be converted from one type of habitat to another. A recently created habitat might suffer from a reduced biodiversity because of the absence of adapted species that need a certain amount of time to colonize the new patch (e.g. direct meta-population effect). Thus landscape dynamics lead to complex habitat spatiotemporal structured, in which each patch is more or less continuous in space and time. In this study, we define habitat spatial structure as the degree to which a habitat is isolated from another habitat of the same kind and temporal structure as the time since the habitat is in place. Patches can also display reduced biodiversity because their spatial or temporal structures are correlated with habitat quality (e.g. indirect effects). We discriminated direct meta-community effects from indirect (habitat quality) effects of the spatiotemporal structure of habitats on biodiversity using Collembola as a model. We tested the relative importance of spatial and temporal structure of habitats for collembolan diversity, taking soil properties into account. In an agroforested landscape, we set up a sampling design comprised of two types of habitats (agriculture versus forest), a gradient of habitat isolation (three isolation classes) and two contrasting ages of habitats. Our results showed that habitat temporal structure is a key factor shaping collembolan diversity. A reduced diversity was detected in recent habitats, especially in forests. Interactions between temporal continuity and habitat quality were also detected by taking into account soil properties: diversity increased with soil carbon content, especially in old forests. Negative effects of habitat age on diversity were stronger in isolated patches. We conclude that habitat temporal structure is a key factor shaping collembolan diversity, while direction and amplitude of its effect depend on land use type and spatial isolation.

A case study of antagonistic butterfly larvae-plant networks","Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species richness in fragmented habitats and can lead to immediate or time-delayed species extinctions. Asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt between interacting species may have severe effects on ecological networks. However, these effects remain largely unknown. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch and landscape changes on antagonistic butterfly larvae-plant trophic networks in Mediterranean grasslands in which previous studies had shown the existence of extinction debt in plants but not in butterflies. We sampled current species richness of habitat-specialist and generalist butterflies and vascular plants in 26 grasslands. We assessed the direct effects of historical and current patch and landscape characteristics on species richness and on butterfly larvae-plant trophic network metrics and robustness. Although positive species- and interactions-area relationships were found in all networks, structure and robustness was only affected by patch and landscape changes in networks involving the subset of butterfly specialists. Larger patches had more species (butterflies and host plants) and interactions but also more compartments, which decreased network connectance but increased network stability. Moreover, most likely due to the rescue effect, patch connectivity increased host-plant species (but not butterfly) richness and total links, and network robustness in specialist networks. On the other hand, patch area loss decreased robustness in specialist butterfly larvae-plant networks and made them more prone to collapse against host plant extinctions. Finally, in all butterfly larvae-plant networks we also detected a past patch and landscape effect on network asymmetry, which indicates that there were different extinction rates and extinction debts for butterflies and host plants. We conclude that asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt in butterfly-plant networks provoked by patch and landscape changes caused changes in species richness and network links in all networks, as well as changes in network structure and robustness in specialist networks.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JUN","OIKOS","127","6","803","813","10.1111/oik.04536","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000434153600005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Guardiola, Moises et al.

Grasslands cover large areas of many countries, provide high levels of provisioning ecosystem services and are an important habitat for many species. While grasslands are often anthropogenic in nature, human-induced environmental perturbations are acknowledged threats to their biodiversity and functioning. Using a repeat survey of grassland plots in Scotland, UK we identified long-term changes in community composition and species indices over a 40 year period (1973-2013).Scottish grasslands were found to have changed significantly over this time. Species richness increased, while diversity declined as dominant species increased in cover. Nitrogen-demanding and moisture-requiring species increased, possibly reflecting increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition and rainfall over this time. In Acid and Nardus grasslands species with low tolerance to very acidic soils increased, possibly reflecting a decrease in sulphur deposition. Overall beta-diversity showed no change, indicating that contrary to trends in other habitats, homogenisation has not occurred. In general bryophytes and low-growing forb and grass species declined while taller species increased. This may reflect either the decline in grazing in recent years or the increase in atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Species richness increased but the majority of species declined in cover while a few dominant species increased suggesting that an extinction debt may be establishing.

Detecting such extinction debts opens opportunities to counteract future biodiversity loss, yet knowing the underlying causes of population declines is a basic need for targeting specific guidelines for conservation and restoration (e.g. habitat quantity, quality or connectivity). Here, we examine the extinction debt in the common Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) occurring in woodland patches of a highly fragmented region that has lost nearly half of the remnant woodland cover during the last 50years (1956-2002). We sampled myrtle occurrence in 304 woodland patches and modelled its probability of occurrence in relation to patch size, patch disturbance and woodland cover in the surrounding landscape. In order to test for extinction debt evidence, we tested whether myrtle occurrence is better predicted by past (1956) than by present (2002) woodland cover. We found that the probability of myrtle occurrence is associated with present patch features (size and disturbance) that are linked to causes of individual mortality and/or recruitment collapse. However, it was associated with past - rather than present - woodland cover in the surrounding landscape, proving a still unpaid extinction debt. Specifically, myrtle occurrence is very unlikely in small and highly disturbed patches located in long-term deforested landscapes.Synthesis and applications. Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity. However, these populations still offer management opportunities, and reducing disturbances and improving habitat quality, especially within small woodland patches, should be a top priority for conservation and restoration.Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity.

In this study, we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be found in clear-cuts after at least 80years as coniferous production forest by comparing floras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits reflecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land use. Clear-cuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36% higher species richness and 35% higher richness of grassland indicator species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory, compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction debts of the flora, these young forests offer opportunities for grassland restoration at large scales.

Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate.LocationBonga, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia.MethodsWe studied 50 trees that had been isolated for periods ranging from a few years to half a century after clearing. The trees were now located in the agricultural landscape at different distances from intact Afromontane forests. Fourteen trees in the forests were used as references. Each tree was inventoried for all vascular epiphytic plants, mosses and liverworts.ResultsTime since clearance had a direct negative effect on number of forest specialist species via delayed extinctions and the detected large extinction debt of both bryophytes and vascular plants continued to be paid over several decades. However, time since clearance had an indirect positive effect on number of forest indicator species via the reappearance of shade from coffee planted surrounding the trees, even if the waiving effect on the extinction debt was rather small. Additionally, trees at further distances from the forest edge had fewer forest-associated species.Main conclusionsOur results show that the ability of agroecological landscapes to foster forest biodiversity may be overestimated if meta-community processes over time and space are not taken into account.

"JOUR",NA,"Berglund, Hakan and Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar","Assessing the extinction vulnerability of wood-inhabiting fungal species in fragmented northern Swedish boreal forests","Fragmentation of old-growth forests and greatly reduced amounts of coarse dead wood in managed forests threat the persistence of many saproxylic species in boreal Fennoscandia. Individual old-growth forest remnants may lose species over time as they pay off their extinction debt. We tested this by comparing the observed site occupancy of individual wood-inhabiting fungal species in isolated old-growth stands (i.e. woodland key habitats; WKHs) with statistical predictions of their occupancy assuming potential extinction debt had already been paid off. The occupancy of species was analysed in two sets of WKHs differing in time since isolation (i.e. recent and old isolates).Few species occurred more frequently than expected in WKHs. However, patterns across species and across all WKHs masked important differences among species in their risk of facing future extinction. The site occupancy decreased significantly between recent and old isolates for a group of annual, red-listed specialist fungal species, suggesting that an extinction debt in WKHs may exist among specific species confined to coarse dead wood and old-growth forest habitat. Generalist species that also occur in the surrounding matrix showed no negative trends, or actually increased in site occupancy, making future extinctions less likely. Thus, continuing loss of threatened species are likely if not preservation of WKHs are combined with other conservation efforts in managed forest landscapes. Natural forest landscapes may serve as important references when aiming to identify species in risk of future extinction but more detailed knowledge about the biology of the most vulnerable species is also required.

Catalogue of the trees, shrubs and vines of Alabama, with their economic properties and local distribution","Part 1 (1913, Monogr. 8) classified the forests of the state by regions. The present volume classifies the same forests by species (including shrubs and woody vines), giving for each, as far as practicable, economic properties, usual habitat (with special reference to the normal frequency of fire), and known distribution within the state, by regions, of which 15 major ones and several subdivisions are recognized. The treatment of several of the more important or interesting species is completed by photographic illustrations or distribution maps, or both. In a few cases photographs of the same tree at intervals of several years (in 2 cases over 21 years) are used. There is a bibliography of 139 titles. One chapter discusses natural regions, soil and climate (with 5 maps); and the catalogue of species is followed by a tabular summary and a few pages of notes on northern and southern limits and other peculiarities of local distribution. The records of distribution are based mostly on the author's field work in every county in the State, including about 30,000 locality records for trees and half as many for shrubs. The author estimates for the State 73 native species large enough for lumber, 63 smaller trees, 32 woody vines, and 150 shrubs, besides 25 introduced trees, vines and shrubs. These figures are probably not exceeded by any other state in the Union except Florida. The Crataegus problem is discussed (6 pp.), and it is pointed out that the number of species credited to Alabama at different times by different authorities has varied as follows: 9 species and 1 variety in 1892 (Sargent, trees only); 20 in 1901 (Mohr, trees and shrubs); 63 in 1903 (Beadle, in Small's Flora); 25 (trees only) in 1922 (Sargent), and 1927 (Sudworth). Only 8 species are discussed in the present work. Disregarding Crataegus, the largest genus of trees in Alabama is Quercus, with about 18 species of saw-timber size, 6 small trees, and 3 shrubs; in addition, a few of doubtful occurrence and several hybrids. Of Pinus there are 8 species, and of Hicoria about the same, or more if they were better understood. Only 2 well-marked species (shrubs) are confined to Alabama: Xeviusia alabameusis Gray and Croton alabamensis E. A. Smith. But there are at least 30 alleged species of Crataegus and a few of Primus and Tilia known only from Alabama specimens. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R. M.

Here we combine population genetics with species distribution modelling to assess patterns and causes of extinction or persistence in two cold-adapted species, Salty hastata and Juncus balticus, which survived post-glacial retractions in calcareous fens of the Iberian Peninsula. In both species, we detected extremely-low genetic diversity and clonal strategies in red-listed populations of the most Marginal region (Cantabrian Range), but high genetic diversity linked with sexual reproduction in populations from a less marginal region of the rear edge (Pyrenees). Genetic patterns were partially explained by past and present species climatic niches, more remarkably in the arctic-alpine S. hastata than in the boreo-atlantic J. balticus, suggesting different biogeographic history but similar sensitivity to global change. Our results show different magnitudes of extinction debt in regional populations that have survived in mountain refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Functional extinction of the most marginal populations can be explained by postglacial climate change and the historical decline of mire habitats. In contrast with the current trend of predicting future effects of climate change, we highlight that glacial relict populations might be currently going into extinction in climatically marginal regions. These populations can provide valuable information about the processes involved in species extinctions, improving our capacity to anticipate the effect of global change across regions and habitats.

In this paper, we analysed the species composition of Erica ciliaris and Erica tetralix communities and their relationship to the patch area, as well as the effect of different environmental factors and management. We obtained data of altitude, water-logging degree, area and perimeter, and management type of 30 different sites. Species distribution and species abundance were calculated and the endemic and protected species were identified. We found that the species richness of these communities is related to the distance to the nearest patch and not related to its total area or shape and neither were the number and abundance of the specialist and generalist species, which could be due to the ""extinction debt"". We also found that the species composition is influenced by both the degree of water-logging and the management of the site, as cutting prevents these communities from advancing to the woodland stage.

We evaluated coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping for the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, marsupials, rodents and sigmodontine rodents separately. beta-diversity based on the multiplicative model was used to estimate the number of compartments (groups of sites with similar species composition) in Clementsian structures, and cluster analysis identified which sites formed compartments. Canonical correspondence analysis determined which environmental factors were associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Distance-decay analysis evaluated the spatial structure in small mammal and environmental data, and Mantel tests evaluated correlations between them.Results Rodent metacommunities had Clementsian structure, whereas marsupials had Gleasonian structure. Compartment locations for rodents were consistent with areas of endemism. Temperature seasonality was most associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Assemblage and environmental dissimilarity among sites had significant positive relationships with geographic distance.Main conclusions Compartment locations in Clementsian structures mirrored historical refugium locations and important vicariance events associated with large rivers. Despite extensive deforestation in Atlantic Forest, small mammal distributions are consistent with expectations based on historical biogeography, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have not yet greatly affected geographic distributions of emergent metacommunity structures. However, extinction debt associated with recent fragmentation and habitat loss may exist.

We propose a metapopulation model that combines local colonization within habitat islands and long-distance colonization between islands. We study how regional occupancy dynamics are affected by the multiscale colonization process. We find that the island size distribution (ISD) is a key driver of the long-term occupancy dynamics. When the ISD is heterogeneousthat is, when the size of islands is variablewe show that extinction dynamics become very slow. We demonstrate that this behavior is unrelated to the well-known extinction debt near the critical extinction threshold. Hence, this finding questions the equivalence between extinction debt and critical transitions in the context of metapopulation collapse. Furthermore, we show that long-distance colonization can rescue small islands from extinction and sustain a steady regional occupancy.

"JOUR",NA,"Iacona, Gwenllian D. and Possingham, Hugh P. and Bode, Michael","Waiting can be an optimal conservation strategy, even in a crisis discipline","Biodiversity conservation projects confront immediate and escalating threats with limited funding. Conservation theory suggests that the best response to the species extinction crisis is to spend money as soon as it becomes available, and this is often an explicit constraint placed on funding. We use a general dynamic model of a conservation landscape to show that this decision to ""front-load"" project spending can be suboptimal if a delay allows managers to use resources more strategically. Our model demonstrates the existence of temporal efficiencies in conservation management, which parallel the spatial efficiencies identified by systematic conservation planning. The optimal timing of decisions balances the rate of biodiversity decline (e.g., the relaxation of extinction debts, or the progress of climate change) against the rate at which spending appreciates in value ( e.g., through interest, learning, or capacity building). We contrast the benefits of acting and waiting in two ecosystems where restoration can mitigate forest bird extinction debts: South Australia's Mount Lofty Ranges and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. In both cases, conservation outcomes cannot be maximized byfront-loading spending, and the optimal solution recommends substantial delays before managers undertake conservation actions. Surprisingly, these delays allow superior conservation benefits to be achieved, in less time than front loading. Our analyses provide an intuitive and mechanistic rationale for strategic delay, which contrasts with the orthodoxy of front loaded spending for conservation actions.

This phenomenon is known as extinction debt, which can lead to the underestimation of actual threats to biodiversity. To adequately estimate the condition of recently fragmented plant communities and avoid future loss of species, good indicators of forthcoming extinctions are needed.We studied the behaviour of genetic diversity of a relatively common habitat specialist grass Briza media in fragmented calcareous grasslands in which the extinction debt has been previously documented. Species richness in this system is shown to be determined by historical landscape patterns and human population densities prevailing centuries ago. We hypothesize that genetic diversity in this grassland system is related to current landscape patterns and contemporary human impact since genetic diversity might react more quickly to environmental changes than species diversity.In contrast to species diversity, genetic diversity was indeed best described by current connectivity of grasslands. Additionally, genetic diversity was negatively related to current human population density, indicating an adverse effect of contemporary human settlements on studied species. The faster response of genetic diversity to changed environmental conditions compared to species richness was further supported by the absence of an expected correlation between species richness and genetic diversity.Human population density a century ago had a positive effect on genetic diversity. A similar effect has been demonstrated for species richness in these grasslands, indicating that traditional land use in the past has supported the development of both genetic and species diversity.Synthesis. Genetic diversity of Briza media in fragmented communities is reacting quickly to changes in landscape structure and anthropogenic pressure. Our results confirm that plant species can be prone to genetic deterioration due to habitat fragmentation and negative anthropogenic impact even if the decline in species richness has been delayed by extinction debt. Thus, a decrease of population genetic diversity in fragmented communities can be taken as the first indication of future species losses.",NA,NA,"2009","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC","2009 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","97","6","1329","1336","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01572.x","0022-0477","WOS:000270787100023","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","Article","MALDEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Helm, Aveliina et al.

Estimating the time constants of relaxation, mainly the expected time to first extinction and the commonly used time for half the extinction debt to be paid off (half-life), is crucial for conservation purposes. Currently, there is no agreement on the rate of relaxation and the factors that it depends on. Here we find that half-life increases with area for all groups examined in a large meta-analysis of extinction data.

Population and individual fitness are often compromised in small, degraded and isolated habitats, but extinction can be a slow process and extinction debts are common. Long-lived species are prone to persist as remnant populations in low-quality habitats for a long time, but the population- and individual-level mechanisms of extinction debt remain poorly explored so far. We here investigate the mechanisms involved in the long-term persistence of the common grassland specialist, long-lived, clonal plant Aphyllanthes monspeliensis L. (Asparagaceae) after forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean calcareous grasslands in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). For this purpose, we assess vegetative (above-ground and below-ground) and reproductive plant performance indicators and their habitat and landscape (current and historical) drivers. We confirm the existence of an extinction debt for this species, since current plant frequency is related to historical but not current connectivity, and we also find a positive effect of historical connectivity on seed set. In addition, current tree cover negatively affects individual size and above-ground/below-ground biomass ratio, and biotic soil acidification leads to a reduction in the flowering probability of individuals and stems. However, we also find that current connectivity negatively affects flowering and that tree cover enhances seed set. The forestation process, thus, also exerts a positive effect on some fitness traits, probably by providing a moister environment.Synthesis. Habitat loss and deterioration result in a decreased vegetative performance of Aphyllanthes monspeliensis, a grassland specialist, but show contrasting effects on its reproductive performance. This suggests that the species would perform better in open forests than grasslands in a context of climate change. However, further forest encroachment would increase light competition and soil acidification, threatening its persistence and promoting the payment of the extinction debt if no conservation measures are taken, like opening gaps in forests and enhancing grassland connectivity.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JAN","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","106","1","278","288","10.1111/1365-2745.12860","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000417839700023","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Bagaria, Guillem et al.

The rate of environmental change is a key factor affecting the responses. Adaptation, migration to more favorable habitats, and extinction are fundamental responses that species exhibit to climate change, but extinction is the most extreme one when species are unable to keep pace with climate change. The dynamics of extinction has long been addressed by theories of stochasticity, alternate states, and tipping points. But we are still lacking a non-equilibrium theory that explains how the rate of environmental change affects species responses, especially persistence. Here, we present spatial and non-spatial models of prey-predator interactions with Allee effect and show diverse responses characterized by different rates of environmental change. We show a community collapse to increasing rates of environmental change and also a stabilizing mechanism through unstable states of the non-spatial model. On the other hand, the spatially distributed community through dispersal exhibits multiple responses that include rescue effect, rate-driven extinction, and unexpected critical transitions and regime shifts. Furthermore, our results show a tracking of unstable states describing the role of unstable states in extinction debt and in maintaining spatial heterogeneity. Thus, this study reveals how the rate of environmental change reshapes community responses and predicts community persistence away from equilibrium states and also away from critical points.",NA,NA,"2020","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","2020 DEC","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","13","4","629","643","10.1007/s12080-020-00473-8","1874-1738 and 1874-1746","WOS:000555529600001","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Article","HEIDELBERG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Arumugam, Ramesh et al.

Environmental stochasticity and low demographic rates may cause delayed extinctions of habitat-specialist species that were initially retained within remnant patches after habitat loss and fragmentation. Detecting such extinction debts opens opportunities to counteract future biodiversity loss, yet knowing the underlying causes of population declines is a basic need for targeting specific guidelines for conservation and restoration (e.g. habitat quantity, quality, or connectivity). 2. Here, we examine the extinction debt in the common Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) occurring in woodland patches of a highly fragmented region that has lost nearly half of the remnant woodland cover during the last fifty years (1956-2002). 3. We sampled myrtle occurrence in 304 woodland patches and modelled its probability of occurrence in relation to patch size, patch disturbance and woodland cover in the surrounding landscape. In order to test for extinction debt evidence, we tested whether myrtle occurrence is better predicted by past (1956) than by present (2002) woodland cover. 4. We found that the probability of myrtle occurrence is associated with present patch features (size and disturbance) that are linked to causes of individual mortality and/or recruitment collapse. However, it was associated with past - rather than present - woodland cover in the surrounding landscape, proving a still unpaid extinction debt. Specifically, myrtle occurrence is very unlikely in small and highly disturbed patches located in long-term deforested landscapes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity. However, these populations still offer management opportunities and reducing disturbances and improving habitat quality, especially within small woodland patches, should be a top priority for conservation and restoration.

The dynamic nature of beta diversity (spatial variation in species composition) that derives from such temporal species turnover, however, has received relatively little attention. Here, we disentangled extinction and colonization components of beta diversity by using the sets of species that went locally extinct and that newly colonized the study sites. We applied this concept of extinction and colonization beta diversity to ground vegetation communities that have been repeatedly surveyed in forests where fire and harvesting were experimentally applied. We first found that fire and harvesting caused no effect on beta diversity 2 yr after the treatments. From this result, we might conclude that they did not alter the ways in which species assemble across space. However, when we analyzed the extinction and colonization beta diversity between pre-treatment and 2 yr after the treatments, both measures were found to be significantly lower in burned sites compared to unburned sites (i.e., the groups of excluded and newly colonized species both showed low beta diversity in the burned sites). These results indicate that the fire excluded similar subsets of species across space, making communities become more heterogeneous, but at the same time induced spatially uniform colonization of new species, causing communities to homogenize. Consequently, the effects of these two processes canceled each other out. The relative importance of extinction and colonization components per se also changed temporally after the treatments. Fire and harvesting showed synergetic negative impacts on extinction beta diversity between pre-treatment and 10 yr after the treatments. Overall, analyses using extinction and colonization beta diversity allowed us to detect nonrandom disassembly and reassembly dynamics in ground vegetation communities. Our results suggest that common practices of analyzing beta diversity at one point in time can mask significant variation driven by disturbance. Acknowledging the extinction-colonization dynamics behind beta diversity is essential for understanding the spatiotemporal organization of biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 DEC","ECOLOGY","101","12",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecy.3183","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000596573400007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tatsumi, Shinichi et al.

Understanding of the processes building an extinction debt is fundamentally important for explaining present and future diversity patterns of species in fragmented landscapes. Few empirical studies, however, have examined the responses of different plant functional groups (PFGs) to historical landscape changes. We aimed to reveal PFG-based differences in species' persistence by focusing on their vegetative, reproductive, and dispersal traits. We examined whether the present distributions of PFGs of grassland species in the edges of remnant woodlands established on former semi-natural grasslands are related to the past surrounding landscapes at different time periods and spatial scales. The effects of past landscapes varied significantly among the PFGs. Richness of short, early flowering forbs and tall, late-flowering, wind-dispersed forbs showed significant positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions more than 50 years ago (the 1950s) and at wide spatial scales (more than 1 km(2)). Richness of tall, late-flowering forbs with unassisted and other types of dispersal mechanisms showed positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions in recent times (the 1970s) and at smaller spatial scales (0.25 km(2)). Our results suggested that plant growth form, flowering season and dispersal ability-with additional information on seed bank persistence-can be good indicators for identifying species' specific sensitivity to surrounding habitat loss.

However, the phenomenon of delayed extinctions as a result of habitat loss has rarely been assessed on oceanic islands. In this study, we tested whether extinction debt (ED), in general, occurs on islands and for which taxonomical groups this phenomenon is most pronounced by assessing ED for multiple endemic taxa and for each of the main altitudinal ecosystems in a well-studied oceanic archipelago.Location: Canary Islands.Methods: We characterized habitat preferences for all endemic species of several taxonomic groups (vascular plants, ground and darkling beetles, flies and land snails). Using generalized linear mixed models and available data about habitat distributions, we tested for all taxa and habitat types to determine whether past habitat area better explained current richness of habitat specialists than current habitat area. If so, an extinction debt can be assumed.Results: For all five major habitat types and five taxonomic groups studied, present-day richness of habitat specialists fitted better with past than current habitat area, evidencing habitat-and taxon-specific extinction debts. This pattern was consistent for both long-lived vascular plants and short-lived invertebrates. Single island endemics in each taxonomic group showed steeper slopes of the species-area relationship (SAR) compared to archipelago endemics indicating higher sensitivity to habitat loss which might increase sizes of ED.Conclusion: Despite differences in species' generation times, plants and invertebrates showed delayed extinctions after habitat destruction in the Canary Islands. Our SAR approach suggests that a considerable number of Canary Island endemics will eventually become extinct in the future without further habitat loss. The case of the Canary archipelago is probably not unique. Hence, we interpret our results as a warning for island conservationists that the worst of the extinction crisis on oceanic islands might be yet to come.

"JOUR",NA,"Spalding, Christopher and Hull, Pincelli M.","Towards quantifying the mass extinction debt of the Anthropocene","To make sense of our present biodiversity crises, the modern rate of species extinctions is commonly compared to a benchmark, or 'background,' rate derived from the fossil record. These estimates are critical for bounding the scale of modern diversity loss, but are yet to fully account for the fundamental structure of extinction rates through time. Namely, a substantial fraction of extinctions within the fossil record occurs within relatively short-lived extinction pulses, and not during intervals characterized by background rates of extinction. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to compare the modern event to these pulses than to the long-term average rate. Unfortunately, neither the duration of extinction pulses in the geological record nor the ultimate magnitude of the extinction pulse today is resolved, making assessments of their relative sizes difficult. In addition, the common metric used to compare current and past extinction rates does not correct for large differences in observation duration. Here, we propose a new predictive metric that may be used to ascertain the ultimate extent of the ongoing extinction threat, building on the observation that extinction magnitude in the marine fossil record is correlated to the magnitude of sedimentary turnover. Thus, we propose that the ultimate number of species destined for extinction today can be predicted by way of a quantitative appraisal of humanity's modification of ecosystems as recorded in sediments-that is, by comparing our future rock record with that of the past.

However, many species exhibit a delayed response to environmental changes because of the slow intrinsic dynamics of populations, resulting in extinction debt. We assess directly the changes in habitat characteristic species composition by comparing historical (1923) and current inventories in highly fragmented grasslands. We aim to characterize the species that constitute extinction debt in European calcareous grasslands. Location Europe, Estonia, 5960 degrees N, 2425 degrees E. Methods We related eleven life-history traits and selected habitat preferences to local extinctions of populations in grasslands where extinction debt has been largely paid. Traits were chosen to describe species dispersal and persistence abilities and were quantified from databases. Results The studied grasslands have lost 90% of their area and 30% of their characteristic plant populations in 90 years. Species more prone to local population extinction were characterized by shorter life span, self-pollination, a lack of clonal growth, fewer seeds per shoot, lower average height, lower soil nitrogen preference and higher requirements for light, indicating a limited ability to tolerate the range of changes in biotic and abiotic conditions of the sites. Locally extinct populations were also characterized by wind-dispersed seeds, lower seed weight and lower terminal velocity of seeds, suggesting that species strategies for long-distance dispersal are not favoured in highly fragmented landscapes. Thus, both increased habitat isolation and decreased habitat quality are important in determining local population extinction. Main conclusions Populations more prone to local extinction were characterized by a number of life-history traits, demonstrating a greater extinction risk for species with poorer abilities for local persistence and competition.

"JOUR",NA,"Sang, Anu and Teder, Tiit and Helm, Aveliina and Paertel, Meelis","Indirect evidence for an extinction debt of grassland butterflies half century after habitat loss","Habitat loss often leads to a substantial decline in species richness. However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reflect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterflies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75 years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterflies (those not confined to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterflies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern.

"JOUR",NA,"Cowlishaw, G","Predicting the pattern of decline of African primate diversity: an extinction debt from historical deforestation","Populations that have survived extensive habitat loss may still face extinction owing to a time lag between initial habitat loss and eventual population collapse. Using island biogeography theory, I investigated the potential existence and magnitude of such ""extinction debts"" among African forest primates as a result of historical deforestation. Forest primate species exhibited a classic species-area relationship (S = cA(z)) with forest habitat across African countries I conducted three tests based on the species-area relationship that indicate extinction debts are likely to exist in African forest primates; in particular several national extinctions should have already occurred solely as a result of forest loss in the last 50 years (if extinctions occurred simultaneously with habitat loss), but none of these extinctions have yet taken place. I also used the species-area relationship to predict the number of species that make up the total debt accumulated since deforestation began in these countries. My, results suggest that in most countries the debt currently consists of over 30% of the forest primate fauna, which usually constitutes between four and eight species. These figures are likely to be accurate because the same model pl edicts with a reasonable degree of precision (1) the severity of threat of extinction from deforestation faced by country endemics, (2) the distribution of regional community endemics threatened by deforestation, and (3) the total number of African species threatened by deforestation (according to the 1996 IUCN Red List).

Zachariah","Declining old-forest species as a legacy of large trees lost","Aim: Global declines in large old trees from selective logging have degraded old-forest ecosystems, which could lead to delayed declines or losses of old-forest-associated wildlife populations (i.e., extinction debt). We applied the declining population paradigm and explored potential evidence for extinction debt in an old-forest dependent species across landscapes with different histories of large tree logging.Location: Montane forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA.Methods: We tested hypotheses about the influence of forest structure on territory extinction dynamics of the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) using detection/non-detection data from 1993 to 2011 across two land tenures: national forests, which experienced extensive large tree logging over the past century, and national parks, which did not.Results: Large tree/high canopy cover forest was the best predictor of extinction rates and explained 26%-77% of model deviance. Owl territories with more large tree/high canopy cover forest had lower extinction rates, and this forest type was similar to 4 times more prevalent within owl territories in national parks ((x) over bar = 19% of territory) than national forests ((x) over bar = 4% of territory). As such, predicted extinction probability for an average owl territory was similar to 2.5 times greater in national forests than national parks, where occupancy was declining ((sic) < 1) and stable ((sic) = 1), respectively. Large tree/high canopy cover forest remained consistently low, but did not decline, during the study period on national forests while owl declines were ongoing-an observation consistent with an extinction debt.Main conclusions: In identifying a linkage between large trees and spotted owl dynamics at a regional scale, we provide evidence suggesting past logging of large old trees may have contributed to contemporary declines in an old-forest species.

A better understanding of factors increasing survival probability of red-listed species is needed for a more efficient conservation effort. Here, we investigated the importance of current forest cover, historical forest cover and a number of soil and climate variables on the incidence and richness of red-listed forest species in Denmark. We considered eight major taxa separately (mammals, saproxylic beetles, butterflies, vascular plants and four groups of fungi), using mainly citizen science data from several national mapping projects. Taxa were selected to represent important forest habitats or properties (soil, dead wood, forest glades and landscape context) and differ in dispersal potential and trophic strategy. For all groups, presence and richness of red-listed species was positively related with current forest cover, but-for most taxa-forest cover 200 years ago was an even better predictor. The intersection of past and current deciduous forest was used to identify the area of continuous, lost and new forest. Continuous and lost deciduous forest cover were strong predictors of red-listed species occurrence in most groups, but surprisingly species richness of butterflies and hydnoid fungi, and presence of mammals, was significantly, positively affected by coniferous forest area. The positive effect of lost deciduous forests on red-listed species, suggest an extinction debt of at least 200 years, with some areas hosting more red-listed species than the current area of old forest can sustain in the long run. Our results suggest that current priorities for forest conservation in Denmark are not efficient in protecting red-listed forest species, and that more focus should be put on conserving deciduous forest with long continuity. Furthermore, a multi-taxa approach including a wide array of organism groups with contrasting habitat affiliations, results in a more comprehensive understanding of the requirements of red-listed forest species and necessitate a more focused approach to conservation planning.

O.","Unbalanced species losses and gains lead to non-linear trajectories as grasslands become forests","Questions Rates of plant community shifts after environmental changes depend on how quickly affected species are gained and lost. Understanding how the balance between extinction and colonisation varies over time, and how it is influenced by local and landscape factors, is essential to understanding overall change trajectories. Investigating change requires data at several time steps over sufficient periods, and the paucity of such data represents an important knowledge gap. We ask: (a) how variation over time in the rates of species' extinction and species' colonization controls the trajectory of biodiversity change in abandoned semi-natural grasslands? and (b) can landscape composition and habitat history modify change trajectories by acting independently on groups within plant communities? Location Sweden, Stockholm Archipelago. Methods We use data on plant composition, management history and landscape context in former grasslands, abandoned at different points since 1901, in a space-for-time analysis, comparing rates of grassland species loss and forest species establishment and investigating resulting biodiversity trajectories. Results Grassland species declined steeply in recently abandoned habitats before levelling off, while the accumulation of forest species was linear, with no plateau reached even at the longest time since abandonment. Hence, we observed a trough in biodiversity, with an initial decline in overall species richness followed by a partial recovery. Only forest species gain was enhanced by nearby habitat availability. Conclusions Information on community compositional changes over short time periods may be misleading about the extent and even direction of ongoing biodiversity gains and losses. Moreover, the non-linear changes observed suggest thresholds in time, after which succession to the forest community accelerates and the ability to manage a return to the grassland community diminishes.

Methods: In this study, we investigated how the perceived importance of ecosystem services may impact the overall benefit provided by managed watersheds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest over a 45-year period, using standardized measures of service capacity weighted by service importance weights derived from a survey of beneficiaries. Results: The capacity of watersheds to regulate water flow and quality was high in all watersheds throughout the study period, whereas cultural services such as scenic beauty declined after harvest. Impacts on greenhouse gas regulation depended on the efficiency with which harvested biomass was used. Surveys revealed that stakeholders placed high value on all ecosystem services, with regulating and cultural services seen as more important than provisioning services. When service metrics were weighted by survey responses and aggregated into a single measure, total service provision followed the same overall trend as greenhouse gas regulation. Where biomass use was less efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, harvesting resulted in an overall ""ecosystem service debt"" where use was more efficient, this ""ecosystem service debt"" was reduced. Beneficiaries' educational backgrounds significantly affected overall assessment of service provision. Beneficiaries with college or university degrees incurred smaller ""ecosystem service debts"" and were less negatively affected by harvesting overall.

Because of a lack of temporal data, long-term impacts are generally investigated less frequently than short-term impacts. However, these effects are equally important for understanding biodiversity loss. We developed a Bayesian Island Biogeography model combining historical imagery and current species distribution to investigate the long-term impacts of urbanization-induced habitat loss and isolation on birds. We surveyed 101 bird species in 43 urban forest patches in a South American city with different combinations of size, isolation, and time since the last abrupt change in area. Based on the current and historical landscape configuration, we estimated the temporal dynamics between species extinction rate and area, and between immigration rate and isolation. Additionally, we used model parameters to forecast bird extinction debts. Large patches had lower extinction rates than small patches, and immigration rates were lower in more isolated patches. Furthermore, current bird species richness was better explained by current landscape configuration than by past configuration, suggesting that birds rapidly respond to changes in urban landscapes and there are no apparent extinction debts. Indeed, we found that habitat loss reduces species diversity to a new equilibrium in relatively short period (less than 10 years), and model projections indicate that bird richness will remain similar to the present if patch area is maintained. Habitat loss is the most important cause of species local extinctions in urban areas, and tropical cities could rapidly promote biodiversity by restoring forest cover.",NA,NA,"2020","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2021 APR","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","256",NA,NA,NA,"10.6084/m9.figshare.12217694.v3","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","DRCI:DATA2020117018950605","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Data set","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Dri, Gabriela Franzoi et al.

With networks typically occurring as local interaction networks interconnected in space (a meta-network), we may ask how the loss of specific habitat fragments affects the overall robustness of the meta-network. To address this question, for an empirical meta-network of plants, herbivores and natural enemies we simulated the removal of habitat fragments in increasing and decreasing order of area, age and connectivity for plant extinction and the secondary extinction of herbivores, natural enemies and their interactions. Meta-network robustness was characterized as the area under the curve of remnant species or interactions at the end of a fragment removal sequence. To pinpoint the effects of fragment area, age and connectivity, respectively, we compared the observed robustness for each removal scenario against that of a random sequence. The meta-network was more robust to the loss of old (i.e. long-fragmented), large, connected fragments than of young (i.e. recently fragmented), small, isolated fragments. Thus, young, small, isolated fragments may be particularly important to the conservation of species and interactions, while contrary to our expectations larger, more connected fragments contribute little to meta-network robustness. Our findings highlight the importance of young, small, isolated fragments as sources of species and interactions unique to the regional level. These effects may largely result from an unpaid extinction debt, in which case these fragments are likely to lose species over time. Yet, there may also be more long-lasting effects from cultivated lands (e.g. water, fertilizers and restricted cattle grazing) and network complexity in small, isolated fragments. Such fragments may sustain important biological diversity in fragmented landscapes, but maintaining their conservation value may depend on adequate restoration strategies. To build the meta-network we considered all plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions (as presence-absence data) recorded in 14 habitat fragments, which involved plant species (herbs and shrubs), endophagous herbivores (gall makers or gall inquilines, and leaf miners), ectophagous herbivores (scale insects and aphids), and their natural enemies (parasitoids, hyperparasitoids and predators). To explore fragment contribution to meta-network robustness, we sorted the 14 habitat fragments according to their area, age and six connectivity metrics combining geographical distances among fragments, neighboring area and similarity in plant resources among fragments. For each fragment removal, we considered secondary extinctions of herbivores and tertiary extinctions of natural enemies as consequence of the local extinction of plant resource, and calculated remnant species richness and trophic interactions. We calculated meta-network robustness as the area under the curve of remnant species and interactions for a specific removal sequence for each trophic guild and interaction type. Finally, we compared observed robustness for each removal rule against calculated robustness for 100 random fragment removals.

"JOUR",NA,"Nadeau, Christopher P. and Urban, Mark C.","Eco-evolution on the edge during climate change","We urgently need to predict species responses to climate change to minimize future biodiversity loss and ensure we do not waste limited resources on ineffective conservation strategies. Currently, most predictions of species responses to climate change ignore the potential for evolution. However, evolution can alter species ecological responses, and different aspects of evolution and ecology can interact to produce complex eco-evolutionary dynamics under climate change. Here we review how evolution could alter ecological responses to climate change on species warm and cool range margins, where evolution could be especially important. We discuss different aspects of evolution in isolation, and then synthesize results to consider how multiple evolutionary processes might interact and affect conservation strategies. On species cool range margins, the evolution of dispersal could increase range expansion rates and allow species to adapt to novel conditions in their new range. However, low genetic variation and genetic drift in small range-front populations could also slow or halt range expansions. Together, these eco-evolutionary effects could cause a three-step, stop-and-go expansion pattern for many species. On warm range margins, isolation among populations could maintain high genetic variation that facilitates evolution to novel climates and allows species to persist longer than expected without evolution. This 'evolutionary extinction debt' could then prevent other species from shifting their ranges. However, as climate change increases isolation among populations, increasing dispersal mortality could select for decreased dispersal and cause rapid range contractions. Some of these eco-evolutionary dynamics could explain why many species are not responding to climate change as predicted. We conclude by suggesting that resurveying historical studies that measured trait frequencies, the strength of selection, or heritabilities could be an efficient way to increase our eco-evolutionary knowledge in climate change biology.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 JUL","ECOGRAPHY","42","7","1280","1297","10.1111/ecog.04404","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000473712400003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Nadeau, Christopher P. et al.

A.","Extinction debt and the role of static and dynamical fragmentation on biodiversity","The mass-extinction events caused by human-driven habitat loss are a current concern in conservation science. However, the observed number of extinctions is considerably smaller than predicted. The overestimation of extinction rates comes from the time-delay which depends on the species sensitivity to habitat changes. The standard method of predicting the effect of habitat loss on biodiversity is to use the species-area relationship and progressively following it backwards to smaller areas. The difference between the actual number of species and the one provided by the backwards species-area relationship is dubbed extinction debt. Previous studies in general adopt a static view for the spatial distribution of species. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the problem urges us to adopt a dynamic framework to this issue since the time between disturbances of the landscape plays an active role in influencing the strength of the extinction debt. In this context, here we address two distinct approaches for this question: a static and a dynamic view of fragmentation. In the former we quantify the extinction debt in a quenched spatial distribution of species, whereas in the latter the community is let to evolve between disturbance events of the landscape. Here we show that the size of the extinction debt depends on the pattern of the fragmentation. It is found that random distributions of destroyed habitats provide larger extinction debts than those obtained for contiguous areas of fragmentation. Furthermore, in the dynamic approach it is observed that dispersal can lead to unexpected outcomes such as lower biodiversity levels than ones inferred from the backwards species-area relationship.

Hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) are biodiversity hot spots for deadwood-dependent insect species, and the main objective of this paper was to test the effect of habitat history and current habitat distribution at various spatial scales on the associated beetle community. We used a gradient spanning 40 km from the coast to inland areas reflecting historical logging intensity (later and lower intensities inland) through 500 years in Southern Norway, to investigate whether the historical variation in oak density is influencing the structure of beetle communities in hollow oaks today. We trapped beetles in 32 hollow oaks along this gradient in forested and seminatural landscapes over two summers. We found higher species richness and total abundance inland consistent with our expectation based on historic logging intensity. Scale-specific environmental variables also affected the response; beetle abundances were controlled by local conditions, whereas beetle species richness responded to habitat on the landscape scale.

D. and Chisholm, Ryan A. and Rosindell, James","Characterising extinction debt following habitat fragmentation using neutral theory","Habitat loss leads to species extinctions, both immediately and over the long term as 'extinction debt' is repaid. The same quantity of habitat can be lost in different spatial patterns with varying habitat fragmentation. How this translates to species loss remains an open problem requiring an understanding of the interplay between community dynamics and habitat structure across temporal and spatial scales. Here we develop formulas that characterise extinction debt in a spatial neutral model after habitat loss and fragmentation. Central to our formulas are two new metrics, which depend on properties of the taxa and landscape: 'effective area', measuring the remaining number of individuals and 'effective connectivity', measuring individuals' ability to disperse through fragmented habitat. This formalises the conventional wisdom that habitat area and habitat connectivity are the two critical requirements for long-term preservation of biodiversity. Our approach suggests that mechanistic fragmentation metrics help resolve debates about fragmentation and species loss.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 DEC","ECOLOGY LETTERS","22","12","2087","2096","10.1111/ele.13398","1461-023X and 1461-0248","WOS:000489834600001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Thompson, Samuel E.

Many of these effects are negative and unwanted, yet there is serious debate whether invasions can cause extinctions - except on islands that are acknowledged to be especially vulnerable. Invasions are increasing world-wide, and the traditional view that Europe and Europeans are mostly responsible for supplying non-native species to areas they colonised, is no longer tenable. Europe today has over 10,000 non-native, naturalised species, several of them causing environmental harm. Although records of invertebrate extinctions are scarce, a recent global synthesis for vertebrates indicates the potential of invasive organisms to cause extinctions in the invaded areas. Simple biogeographical considerations show that isolation has been important in generating the current global biodiversity. Unchecked, unlimited invasions will decrease global biodiversity, mainly by removing these biogeographical barriers. Due to the phenomenon of extinction debt, these detrimental effects may remain hidden for centuries.",NA,NA,"2018",NA,"2018","Atti della Accademia Nazionale Italiana di Entomologia Rendiconti","66",NA,"149","150",NA,"0065-0757","ZOOREC:ZOOR15507044344",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lovei, Gabor L.

The simulated results show that under continuous habitat destruction at different time scales such as ten-thousand time scale in the primitive Agriculture Era, millenary time scale in the Agricultural Revolution Era and Industrial Era, species in different metacommunities will go extinct from the best to the poorest before complete destruction. The survival species will go extinct collectively when habitat is destroyed completely. If continuous habitat destruction only last a short period of time, no species will go extinct. Instantaneous destruction brought by human activities such as in the rapid urban expansion period has long-term influences on the abundances of all species, i.e., the time debt for species to respond to habitat destruction would be very long.

Based on capture-mark-recapture and winter nest census data, we first estimated demography (survival and recruitment rates, population size, density dependence) and dispersal parameters (emigration rate, effect of patch connectivity on dispersal, mortality during dispersal). Then using RAMAS/GIS platform, we parameterised a population viability analysis (PVA) model with these parameters to simulate the future of this metapopulation under different scenarios.The metapopulation does not seem viable even if natural reforestation is controlled by adequate management. In its present state, the patch system is not able to sustain enough individuals: due to the large temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters, a carrying capacity far higher than currently would be necessary to limit extinction risk to 1%, suggesting the existence of an extinction debt for the species in Belgium. The situation of E aurinia appears much worse compared to two other fritillary species threatened in Belgium, for which similar PVA are available. It is therefore urgent to increase the carrying capacity of the patch system. How and where it is achieved are of secondary importance for the gain in viability: improvement of habitat quality through restoration, or increase of habitat quantity via enlargement of existing patches and/or creation of new habitat in the matrix. A regime of management based on regular re-opening and maintenance of habitat patches may be the only guarantee of long-term persistence for this critically endangered species in Belgium.

Here, we use a hybrid model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44-50% by the end of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most 'optimistic' static model (49%). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40% of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt(5,6).

However, there is typically a time-lag between the reduction in habitat area and the eventual disappearance of the remnant populations. These ""surviving but ultimately doomed"" species represent an extinction debt. Calculating the magnitude of such future extinction events has been hampered by potentially inaccurate assumptions about the slope of species-area relationships, which are habitat- and taxon-specific. We overcome this challenge by applying a method that uses the historical sequence of deforestation in the Azorean Islands, to calculate realistic and ecologically-adjusted species-area relationships. The results reveal dramatic and hitherto unrecognized levels of extinction debt, as a result of the extensive destruction of the native forest:> 95%, in < 600 yr. Our estimations suggest that more than half of the extant forest arthropod species, which have evolved in and are dependent on the native forest, might eventually be driven to extinction. Data on species abundances from Graciosa Island, where only a very small patch of secondary native vegetation still exists, as well as the number of species that have not been found in the last 45 yr, despite the extensive sampling effort, offer support to the predictions made. We argue that immediate action to restore and expand native forest habitat is required to avert the loss of numerous endemic species in the near future.",NA,NA,"2010","WILEY","2010 APR","ECOGRAPHY","33","2","285","294","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06203.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000279073000009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Triantis, Kostas A. et al.

For effective wildlife management in urban landscapes, it is essential to consider the complex history of urbanization and its time-delayed effects on species distribution. We examined whether the history of local land use affects the time-delayed response of Japanese hares (Lepus brachyurus) to landscape change in an urban ecosystem by hierarchically reducing the factors affecting differences in the response. We evaluated the occurrence of hares in 62 forest patches along an urban gradient in the Tama Hills area, Japan. Using sites where the surrounding landscape remained relatively stable, we calculated the habitat threshold of hare occurrence based on the surrounding forest area. We extracted sites that used to be suitable for hare occurrence in the past but later on surpassed the identified habitat threshold (i.e., 'regressive sites') and analyzed the landscape factors explaining the extinction debt of hares. Finally, we mapped potential extinction debt throughout the study region. We detected possible extinction debt in 4 regressive sites. We also found that forest patch size and the number of surrounding forest patches were related to hare occurrence. Based on this prediction, several other sites with potential extinction debt were identified in the study region. We found that the delayed response of the Japanese hares is likely caused by differences in forest fragmentation processes at each site. Our hierarchical approach could be an effective methodology for detecting and explaining the cause of extinction debt at the local scale and would contribute to the management of urban land for wildlife conservation.",NA,NA,"2016","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","2016 SEP 27","JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY","97","5","1451","1460","10.1093/jmammal/gyw085","0022-2372 and 1545-1542","WOS:000385628300021","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","Article","CARY",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Saito, Masayuki U. et al.

The discovery of oceanic islands and other pristine habitats by European navigators and the consequent introduction of destructive mammals, such as rats and goats, started a process of anthropogenic extinction. Much ecosystem change happened before systematic scientific recording, so has led to DE. Statistical methods are available to robustly estimate DE in the 'taxonomic period'. For the 'pre-taxonomic period', simple extrapolation can be used. The application of these techniques to world birds, for example, suggests that approximately 56 DEs occurred in the 'taxonomic period' (1800-present) and approximately 180 in the 'pre-taxonomic period' (1500-1800).

The small proportion of remaining vegetation and its fragmented and degraded nature will probably mean that a long-term extinction debt will have to be paid. For some species this will be through the process of successive extinctions of sub-populations and lack of recolonization due to poor dispersal ability, leading to ultimate extinction of the metapopulation. However, many bird species in Australia travel locally and regionally to exploit resources that vary in time and space (rich-patch nomads), and appear to be quite capable of dispersing in fragmented landscapes. Many of these too are declining and we need to understand the processes involved in their decline. Making the matrix mere hospitable may reverse the declines of the poor dispersers. However, a different approach may be needed to assist the rich-patch nomads, such as re-establishing key resources.

To address this gap, we investigated extinction times in time-varying, demographically stochastic versions of the logistic model for population dynamics. A property of these models is the extinction delay,"" a quantitative measure of the time lag in extinction created by species-specific extinction debt. For completeness, three models were constructed to represent the different demographic routes by which deterioration may affect population dynamics. Numerical analysis for two notional life histories indicated that the demographic response to environmental deterioration had a large effect on extinction delay, but a third analysis showed that the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity ultimately characterized its magnitude. A concave decline in carrying capacity produced a large extinction delay while a small delay occurred with a convex decline. Furthermore, our results explore the non-monotonicity of extinction debt with respect to the speed of deterioration. A peak is present at low levels of deterioration, and the height of the peak and the asymptote of delay are affected by both life history parameterizations and the rate of change of the carrying capacity. The results suggest that population viability analyses must consider not only environmental deterioration, but also the effects of deterioration on the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity.",NA,NA,"2017","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","2017 MAR","THEORETICAL ECOLOGY","10","1","65","71","10.1007/s12080-016-0311-2","1874-1738 and 1874-1746","WOS:000397924000005","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Article","HEIDELBERG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Zarada, Katherine et al.

When subsequently applied by conservation agencies in summary metrics tracking habitat and species protection, these patterns in biodiversity loss or gain can fail to capture outcomes for groups that have a prominent importance in habitat composition, diversity and ecological function, such as algae, bryophytes, lichens and other fungi. Such species are primarily recorded on an ad hoc basis by taxonomic specialists, yielding noisy data that present problems in robustly identifying trends. This study explored the use of ad hoc field-recorded data as a potential source of biodiversity information, by comparing the pattern of recording for carefully selected indicator species with those for benchmark or control species as a proxy for recording effort. Focusing on Scotland's internationally important epiphytic lichens, and especially 'old-growth' indicator species, British Lichen Society data revealed a decline in the extent of these species in Scotland, relative to recording effort, over a period of five decades. A recent slowing in the rate of decline is observed but remains to be confirmed. The long-term decline is consistent with the effect of land use intensification, resulting in small and isolated populations that are vulnerable to extinction debt.

Recent studies have revealed that extinction events often occur with a time delay. In ecology, this phenomenon is termed extinction debt. Here we give an overview of the concept of extinction debt and its implications for biodiversity conservation.Extinction debt refers to the phenomenon that populations or species become extinct with a time lag and not immediately after habitat conditions have deteriorated. The causes for the occurrence of extinction debt can vary widely. In the simplest case, a long-lived species is no longer able to reproduce as much as would be necessary for the longterm survival of its population.The time delay between the occurrence of the environmental change and the extinction event may result in a lack of identification or a misidentification of the relevant causes. This is especially true for gradual environmental changes, for example in habitat quality. At worst, the real cause will not be detected as it occurred several years or even decades earlier.",NA,NA,"2021",NA,"2021","Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung","53","5","14","19","10.1399/NuL.2021.05.01","0940-6808","BCI:BCI202100549815",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Fartmann, Thomas et al.

European dry grasslands are particularly endangered. However, the persistence of populations can temporarily, mitigate species loss - a process referred to as 'extinction debt'. We test this hypothesis using historical and present day habitat maps and current plant biodiversity data collected in the forest-steppe zone of Europe. In 16 5 km x 5 km study sites, representing the landscape heterogeneity of the Kiskunsag region (Hungary), 86 20 m x 20 m vegetation plots were surveyed in open and closed calcareous sand grasslands. Grassland diversity was measured as the number of specialist species, defined by statistical fidelity measures using primary and secondary grassland plots. Landscape context was quantified using the areal extent of semi-natural forest-steppe vegetation in a 300 m neighborhood of the plots, based on recent and historical maps (1783, 1860, 1950s, 1987-1989 and 2005). The number of specialist species was estimated with Poisson generalized linear models using the present landscape context, climatic conditions, and a proxy of soil type as covariates. To test for the effect of historical legacies, Pearson residuals from the present models were tested for significant relationships between the residuals and the historical landscape contexts using linear models.We found that the present landscape context had no significant relationship with the specialist species richness of the primary grassland fragments. However, we found a significant relationship between the historical landscape context of the 19th century and the residuals of the present model. Even though the extent of natural vegetation in the 20th century showed more drastic changes, the landscape context in 1950s and 1987-1989 exhibited no significant statistical relationship with the residuals. This delay of species loss is consistent with the extinction debt hypothesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We established a transplant experiment to disentangle the contribution of these processes to the local extinction risk of four alpine plants in the Swiss Alps. Projected population growth (lambda) derived from integral projection models was reduced by 0.07/degrees C of warming on average, whereas novel species additionally decreased lambda by 0.15 across warming levels. Effects of novel species on predicted extinction time were greatest at warming < 2 degrees C for two species. Projected population declines under both warming and with novel species were primarily driven by increased mortality.

This hampers conservation efforts and limits testing of basic tenets of ecology and conservation biology. We used a historical baseline survey to track shifts in the abundance and distribution of 296 native understory species across 82 sites over 55 years in the fragmented forests of southern Wisconsin. We resurveyed stands first surveyed in the early 1950s to evaluate the influence of patch size and surrounding land cover on shifts in native plant richness and heterogeneity and to evaluate changes in the relative importance of local site conditions versus the surrounding landscape context as drivers of community composition and structure. Larger forests and those with more surrounding forest cover lost fewer species, were more likely to recruit new species, and had lower rates of homogenization than smaller forests in more fragmented landscapes. Nearby urbanization further reduced both alpha and beta understory diversity. Similarly, understory composition depended strongly on local site conditions in the original survey but only weakly reflected the surrounding landscape composition. By 2005, however, the relative importance of these factors had reversed such that the surrounding landscape structure is now a much better predictor of understory composition than are local site conditions.

However, local extinction of species can occur with a temporal delay following habitat fragmentation, which is termed extinction debt. Many studies about extinction debt rely on community equilibrium from relationships between species richness and habitat variables. We assumed that the distribution of many vascular plant species in the coastal range of south-central Chile is not in equilibrium with the present habitat distribution. The aim of this research is to quantify patterns of habitat loss and to detect extinction debt from relationships between the current richness of different assemblages of vascular plants (considering longevity and habitat specialization) and both past and current habitat variables. The results showed that native forests have been fragmented and reduced by 53%, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.99%, in the study area between 1979 and 2011. Current richness of plant species was mostly explained by past habitat area and connectivity. Past habitat variables explained best richness of long-lived specialist plants, which are characterized by restricted habitat specialization and slower population turnover. We also showed that habitat fragmentation has resulted in a significant reduction in long-lived plant species' dwelling patch sizes (DPS) between 1979 and 2011. Our analyses provide the first evidence of predicted future losses of plant species in a South American temperate biodiversity hotspot. Consequently, an unknown proportion of the plants in the study area will become extinct if no targeted restoration and conservation action is taken in the near future.",NA,NA,"2019","SPRINGER JAPAN KK","2019 JAN","LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING","15","1","1","12","10.1007/s11355-018-0352-3","1860-1871 and 1860-188X","WOS:000456969700001","SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN","Article","TOKYO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Noh, Jin-kyoung et al.

Species area relationships predict that their habitat fragments will experience a substantial loss of species. Most of these extinctions will occur over an extended time, and therefore, reconnecting fragments could prevent species losses and allow locally extinct species to recolonize former habitats. An empirical relaxation half-life vs. area relationship for tropical bird communities estimates the time that it takes to lose one-half of all species that will be eventually lost. We use it to estimate the increase in species persistence by regenerating a forest connection 1 km in width among the largest and closest fragments at 11 locations. In the Eastern Arc Mountains, regenerating 8,134 ha of forest would create >316,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest. More importantly, it would increase the persistence time for species by a factor of 6.8 per location or 2,272 years, on average, relative to individual fragments. In the Atlantic Forest, regenerating 6,452 ha of forest would create >251,000 ha in total of restored contiguous forest and enhance species persistence by a factor of 13.0 per location or similar to 5,102 years, on average, relative to individual fragments. Rapidly regenerating forest among fragments is important, because mean time to the first determined extinction across all fragments is 7 years.

In forest ecosystems, the influence of landscape history on contemporary biodiversity patterns has been shown to provide a convenient framework to explain shifts in plant assemblages. However, very few studies have controlled for present human-induced activities when analyzing the effect of forest continuity on community structures. By cutting and removing trees, foresters substantially change stand ecological conditions, with consequences on biodiversity patterns. Disentangling the effect of past and present human activities on biodiversity is thus crucial for ecosystem management and conservation. 2. We explored the response of plant and springtail species richness and composition to forest continuity (ancient vs recent) in montane forests, while controlling for stand maturity (mature vs overmature). We established 70 sites in landscapes dominated by unfragmented ancient forests where we surveyed plants and assessed springtails by analyzing environmental DNA. 3. Neither plant nor springtail species richness was influenced by forest continuity or by stand maturity. Instead, site-specific characteristics, especially soil properties and canopy openness, were of major importance in shaping above- and below-ground richness. 4. For plant and springtail species composition, the effect of forest continuity was mediated by stand maturity. Thus, both plants and springtails showed a convergence in assemblage patterns with the increasing availability of overmature stand attributes. Moreover, soil and stand-scale factors were evidently more important than landscape-scale factors in shaping above- and below-ground species composition. 5. Synthesis. We clearly demonstrated that biodiversity patterns are more strongly influenced by present human-induced activities than by past human-induced activities. In the Northern Alps where our study sites were located, the colonization credit of most species has been paid off and the transient biodiversity deficit usually related to forest continuity has moved toward equilibrium. These findings emphasize the necessity to better control for local-scale factors when analyzing the response of biodiversity to forest continuity; we call for more research into the effects of forest continuity in unfragmented mountain forests.

The consensus that has emerged from over two decades of research is that the form of the biodiversity-functioning relationship follows a saturating curve. However, the foundation from which these conclusions are drawn mostly stems from empirical investigations that have not accounted for post-extinction changes in community composition and structure, or how surviving species respond to new circumstances and modify their contribution to functioning. Here, we use marine sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities to experimentally assess whether post-extinction compensatory mechanisms (simulated by increasing species biomass) have the potential to alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relations. Consistent with recent numerical simulations, we find that the form of the biodiversity-function curve is dependent on whether or not compensatory responses are present, the cause and extent of extinction, and species density. When species losses are combined with the compensatory responses of surviving species, both community composition, dominance structure, and the pool and relative expression of functionally important traits change and affect species interactions and behaviour. These observations emphasize the importance of post-extinction community composition in determining the stability of ecosystem functioning following extinction. Our results caution against the use of the generalized biodiversity-function curve when generating probabilistic estimates of post-extinction ecosystem properties for practical application.",NA,NA,"2019","ROYAL SOC","2019 APR 17","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","286","1901",NA,NA,"10.1098/rspb.2019.0287","0962-8452 and 1471-2954","WOS:000465657800015","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Thomsen, Matthias S. et al.

Context Atlantic oakwood, ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW), supports important epiphytic lichens. Fragmented ASNW, historically in-filled with conifers, are now being restored to reflect ASNW tree and ground flora character. Concerns exist that sudden and total removal of the conifer matrix will be detrimental to the epiphyte diversity of remnant trees retained within the former plantation. Aims Here, we ask whether an unintended consequence of habitat restoration is the loss of epiphyte populations on remnant trees. Methods Dynamics of ground flora development were studied at one 50-ha site on the west coast of Scotland using indicator species occurrence and species traits. Change in cover of lichen species was determined and lichen vitality was assessed in two Lobaria species using chlorophyll fluorescence as a proxy. Assessments pre-, post- and nine years after conifer removal were made in plantation areas (containing remnant oak trees) and ASNW areas. Results Re-vegetation of the ground flora was predominantly by ASNW vegetation. Species richness and occurrence of native woodland indicator species increased and the community showed stronger competitor traits. Lichen vitality was initially reduced but recovered. Tests showed change in the abundance of key lichen species and lichen community diversity was non-significant despite the loss of four lichen species on remnant trees. Conclusion Ground flora dynamics indicate site recovery was underway within eight years of restoration activities and epiphytic lichens although variable in response were in this study largely unaffected, this restoration approach could be appropriate for other Atlantic oakwoods where lichen conservation is an objective.",NA,NA,"2021","SPRINGER FRANCE","2021 SEP","ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE","78","3",NA,NA,"10.1007/s13595-021-01069-w","1286-4560 and 1297-966X","WOS:000664479500001","22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE","Article","PARIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Broome, Alice et al.

"DATA",NA,"Zarada, Katherine and Drake, John M","Data from: Time to extinction in deteriorating environments","Habitat degradation and destruction are the predominant drivers of population extinction, but there is little theory to guide the analysis of population viability in deteriorating environments. To address this gap, we investigated extinction times in time-varying, demographically stochastic versions of the logistic model for population dynamics. A property of these models is the extinction delay, a quantitative measure of the time lag in extinction created by species-specific extinction debt. For completeness, three models were constructed to represent the different demographic routes by which deterioration may affect population dynamics. Numerical analysis for two notional life histories indicated that the demographic response to environmental deterioration had a large effect on extinction delay, but a third analysis showed that the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity ultimately characterized its magnitude. A concave decline in carrying capacity produced a large extinction delay while a small delay occurred with a convex decline. Furthermore, our results explore the non-monotonicity of extinction debt with respect to the speed of deterioration. A peak is present at low levels of deterioration, and the height of the peak and the asymptote of delay are affected by both life history parameterizations and the rate of change of the carrying capacity. The results suggest that population viability analyses must consider not only environmental deterioration, but also the effects of deterioration on the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity.

We estimated decade-scale local extinction by resampling 118 stream readies representing the best mussel habitat across a region that was once rich in species and is now mostly converted from prairies and riparian woodlands to intensive agriculture (Iowa, USA). Average species richness was reduced from >5 to <2 species, maximum richness was reduced from 22 to 15 species, and all mussel species were extirpated from 47% of the reaches since 1984 to 1985.

Correlation analyses with reach and watershed characteristics determined using GIS and local sampling methods linked the greatest declines to rarity of streamside woodlands, high siltation, and most intensive agricultural land uses, i.e., where conditions had changed most from the historical land cover.

Location: Houtman Abrolhos archipelago, Western Australia. Taxon: Reptiles. Methods: Nineteen islands were sampled from 2002 - 2012 using foraging and trapping. Body size (snout-vent length) was measured on first capture. Island size varied from 0.3 - 587 ha, encompassing the three geomorphic island types, the three bathymetric groups, and a range of other environmental attributes. Results: From about 1500 captures, 24 reptile species were recorded, including three previously undocumented on the archipelago, and 55 records of species not previously recorded on specific islands. Four significantly different reptile assemblage groups were identified. These were highly correlated with geomorphological composition - two groups encompassing the three large aeolianite islands; another the high rock islands and the largest composite island; and a fourth consisting of the remaining composite islands with one very small high rock island. Both assemblage and richness on islands were significantly correlated with island area, geomorphology and native plant species richness. Of the 13 species captured frequently, eleven showed statistically significant inter-island variation in body size, and two exhibited sexual dimorphism. In three species, size was also correlated with environmental attributes, including reptile species richness, native plant richness, geomorphology and island area. Six of the eleven species captured on the two largest islands (both aeolianite) differed in size on these adjacent islands. Main Conclusions: High inter-island variation in body size and assemblage composition suggest strong differential selection since the most recent isolation event at 6,500 bp. Anthropogenic disturbances over the last 150 years have resulted in several island extinctions. Species assemblage and richness are strongly associated with environmental attributes.

Understanding potential extinction debts would allow us to reduce future extinction risk by restoring habitats or implementing conservation actions. Although growing empirical evidence has predicted extinction debts in various ecosystems exposed to direct human disturbances, potential extinction debts in natural ecosystems with minimal direct human disturbance are little studied. Ongoing climate change may cause habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly in natural ecosystems vulnerable to environmental change, potentially leading to future local extinctions. Recent climate change would lead to extended growing season caused by earlier snowmelt in spring, resulting in expansion of shrubby species and thereby habitat loss and fragmentation of mountainous moorlands. We examined the potential extinction debts of species diversity and functional diversity (FD; trait variation or multivariate trait differences within a community) in subalpine moorland ecosystems subjected to few direct human disturbances. Plant species richness for all species and for moorland specialists were primarily explained by the past kernel density of focal moorlands (a proxy for spatial clustering of moorlands around them) but not the past area of the focal moorlands, suggesting potential extinction debt in subalpine moorland ecosystems. The higher kernel density of the focal moorland in the past indicates that it was originally surrounded by more neighborhood moorlands and/or had been locally highly fragmented. Patterns in current plant species richness have been shaped by the historical spatial configuration of moorlands, which have disappeared over time. In contrast, we found no significant relationships between the FD and historical and current landscape variables depicting each moorland. The prevalence of trait convergence might result in a less sensitive response of FD to habitat loss and fragmentation compared to that of species richness. Our finding has an important implication that climate change induced by human activities may threaten biodiversity in natural ecosystems through habitat loss and fragmentation.",NA,NA,"2021","SPRINGER","2021 APR","PLANT ECOLOGY","222","4","445","457","10.1007/s11258-021-01118-4","1385-0237 and 1573-5052","WOS:000621262700001","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Makishima, Daichi et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Moor, Helen","Life history trade-off moderates model predictions of diversity loss from climate change","Climate change can trigger species range shifts, local extinctions and changes in diversity. Species interactions and dispersal capacity are important mediators of community responses to climate change. The interaction between multispecies competition and variation in dispersal capacity has recently been shown to exacerbate the effects of climate change on diversity and to increase predictions of extinction risk dramatically. Dispersal capacity, however, is part of a species overall ecological strategy and are likely to trade off with other aspects of its life history that influence population growth and persistence. In plants, a well-known example is the trade-off between seed mass and seed number. The presence of such a trade-off might buffer the diversity loss predicted by models with random but neutral (i.e. not impacting fitness otherwise) differences in dispersal capacity. Using a trait-based metacommunity model along a warming climatic gradient the effect of three different dispersal scenarios on model predictions of diversity change were compared. Adding random variation in species dispersal capacity caused extinctions by the introduction of strong fitness differences due an inherent property of the dispersal kernel. Simulations including a fitness-equalising trade-off based on empirical relationships between seed mass (here affecting dispersal distance, establishment probability, and seedling biomass) and seed number (fecundity) maintained higher initial species diversity and predicted lower extinction risk and diversity loss during climate change than simulations with variable dispersal capacity. Large seeded species persisted during climate change, but developed lags behind their climate niche that may cause extinction debts. Small seeded species were more extinction-prone during climate change but tracked their niches through dispersal and colonisation, despite competitive resistance from residents. Life history trade-offs involved in coexistence mechanisms may increase community resilience to future climate change and are useful guides for model development.

Here, we develop a conceptual model of species and community attributes affecting secondary extinction likelihood, incorporating mechanisms that buffer organisms against partner loss. Specialized interactors, including 'cryptic specialists' with diverse but nonredundant partner assemblages, incur elevated risk. Risk is also higher for species that cannot either evolve new traits following partner loss or obtain novel partners in communities reorganizing under changing environmental conditions. Partner loss occurs alongside other anthropogenic impacts; multiple stressors can circumvent ecological buffers, enhancing secondary extinction risk.

Current approaches to estimating extinction from the endemics-area relationship (EAR) estimate only the minimum number of species that can become extinct because of habitat loss (instantaneous extinction). EARs will therefore underestimate extinction if small populations and/or habitat area (SPHA) commit species to future extinction. We demonstrate this mathematically, by assuming species require a minimum population size of two individuals, and by randomly sampling habitat loss within stem-mapped forest plots. We then develop a general framework for incorporating SPHA effects into EARs that builds upon recent advances introducing N into estimates of extinction. By accounting for effects that modify N, our framework explains extinction debt and reduces the uncertainty associated with future estimates of extinction through carefully qualifying the spatial and temporal context of predictions.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 APR","CONSERVATION LETTERS","5","2","149","156","10.1111/j.1755-263X.2011.00221.x","1755-263X","WOS:000303872200009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tanentzap, Andrew J. et al.

Methods: We analysed the local above-ground persistence of vascular plants in permanent plots (monitored once a year for ca. 16 year) with respect to functional traits and habitat preferences using survival statistics (Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox' regression). These methods account for censored data and are rarely used in vegetation ecology.Results: Local above-ground persistence is determined by both functional traits (especially the ability to form long-lived clonal connections) and habitat preferences (especially nutrient requirements). Above-ground persistence is negatively related to the ability for dispersal by wind and to the ability to accumulate a long-term persistent soil seed bank ('dispersal through time') and is positively related to the ability for dispersal by water.Conclusions: Most species have a half-life expectation over 15 years. which may contribute to time lags after changes 'in habitat quality or -configuration ('extinction debt').

For the first time in more than a century, people across the planet are migrating en mass from cities to rural areas. In this process of exurbanisation' humans are rapidly converting natural and agricultural regions into low-density housing. Despite the scale of this exurban development and its potential negative impact on biodiversity, little is known about how this specific type of land conversion impacts wild pollinators. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild pollinators of the peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of current and historic land use at multiple spatial scales on pollinator community composition within agroecological landscapes that have recently undergone exurban development. We reveal that the overall composition of the wild pollinator community is significantly associated with current local agricultural and natural land cover. Specifically, local agricultural land use was associated with ground-nesting bee community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with cavity-nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive community composition for these two groups in exurban habitats. In contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made up the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated with any particular land use type, likely due to their non-central place foraging strategy. Most interestingly, our results indicate that historic land use remains a significant factor impacting the current abundance of all pollinators in the peach agroecosystem, offering the first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly expanding exurban landscape.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 NOV","INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY","8","6","562","572","10.1111/icad.12139","1752-458X and 1752-4598","WOS:000363862300007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cusser, Sarah et al.

Assessing the regional dynamics of plant communities in a fragmented landscape","Understanding the regional dynamics of plant communities is crucial for predicting the response of plant diversity to habitat fragmentation. However, for fragmented landscapes the importance of regional processes, such as seed dispersal among isolated habitat patches, has been controversially debated. Due to the stochasticity and rarity of among-patch dispersal and colonization events, we still lack a quantitative understanding of the consequences of these processes at the landscape-scale. In this study, we used extensive field data from a fragmented, semi-arid landscape in Israel to parameterize a multi-species incidence-function model. This model simulates species occupancy pattern based on patch areas and habitat configuration and explicitly considers the locations and the shapes of habitat patches for the derivation of patch connectivity. We implemented an approximate Bayesian computation approach for parameter inference and uncertainty assessment. We tested which of the three types of regional dynamics - the metacommunity, the mainland-island, or the island communities type - best represents the community dynamics in the study area and applied the simulation model to estimate the extinction debt in the investigated landscape. We found that the regional dynamics in the patch-matrix study landscape is best represented as a system of highly isolated island' communities with low rates of propagule exchange among habitat patches and consequently low colonization rates in local communities. Accordingly, the extinction rates in the local communities are the main drivers of community dynamics. Our findings indicate that the landscape carries a significant extinction debt and in model projections 33-60% of all species went extinct within 1000 yr. Our study demonstrates that the combination of dynamic simulation models with field data provides a promising approach for understanding regional community dynamics and for projecting community responses to habitat fragmentation. The approach bears the potential for efficient tests of conservation activities aimed at mitigating future losses of biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 JUL","ECOGRAPHY","36","7","842","853","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07793.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000320468900010","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"May, Felix et al.

Human activities and both deliberately and inadvertently introduced biota have had and continue to have a severe impact on island endemic plants. The number of alien plants has increased nearly linearly on many islands, perhaps resulting in extinction-based saturation of island floras. Here, we provide evidence for such a scenario in Alejandro Selkirk, Robinson Crusoe Islands (Archipelago Juan Fernandez, Chile). We compared species richness and species composition of historical vegetation samples from 1917 with recent ones from 2011. Changes in species' relative occurrence frequency were related to their taxonomic affiliation, dispersal mode, distribution status, and humidity and temperature preferences. While total species richness of vascular plants remained relatively similar, species composition changed significantly. Plants endemic to the Robinson Crusoe Islands declined, exotic species increased substantially within the period of ca. 100years. Further, the relative occurrence frequency of plants with preferences for very warm and humid climate decreased, while the opposite was found for plants preferring drier and colder environments. Potential drivers responsible for this dramatic shift in the vegetation within only one century might have been the large goat population affecting especially small populations of endemic plants and climatic changes. Taking into account a substantial extinction debt, we expect further shifts in the vegetation of this small oceanic island toward alien plants. This would have significant negative consequences on global biodiversity, considering that island floras contribute substantially to global plant species richness due to their high proportion of endemics.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 MAR","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","8","5","2527","2533","10.1002/ece3.3882","2045-7758","WOS:000426725900013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Greimler, Josef et al.

"JOUR",NA,"He, Fangliang and Hubbell, Stephen P.","Species-area relationships always overestimate extinction rates from habitat loss","Extinction from habitat loss is the signature conservation problem of the twenty-first century(1). Despite its importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by reversing the species-area accumulation curve, extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based on this method are almost always much higher than those actually observed(2-5). This discrepancy gave rise to the concept of an 'extinction debt', referring to species 'committed to extinction' owing to habitat loss and reduced population size but not yet extinct during a non-equilibrium period(6,7). Here we show that the extinction debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying sampling problems when constructing a species-area relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result is that the area required to remove the last individual of a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first individual of a species, irrespective of species distribution and spatial scale.

"JOUR",NA,"Orrock, John L. and Watling, James I.","Local community size mediates ecological drift and competition in metacommunities","The outcome of competitive interactions is likely to be influenced by both competitive dominance (i.e. niche-based dynamics) and ecological drift (i.e. neutral dynamics governed by demographic stochasticity). However, spatial models of competition rarely consider the joint operation of these two processes. We develop a model based on the original competition-colonization trade-off model that incorporates niche and neutral processes and several realistic facets of ecological dynamics: it allows local competition (i.e. competition within a patch) to occur within communities of a finite size, it allows competitors to vary in the degree of competitive asymmetry, and it includes the role of local migration (i.e. propagule pressure). The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e. g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt.",NA,NA,"2010","ROYAL SOC","2010 JUL 22","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","277","1691","2185","2191","10.1098/rspb.2009.2344","0962-8452 and 1471-2954","WOS:000278569700011","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Orrock, John L. et al.

The method has a number of issues that must be handled with care to avoid error. These include the functional form of the SAR, the choice of equation parameters, the sampling procedure used, extinction debt, and forest regeneration. Concerns about the accuracy of the SAR technique often cite errors not much larger than the natural scatter of the SAR itself. Such errors do not undermine the credibility of forecasts predicting large numbers of extinctions, although they may be a serious obstacle in other SAR applications. Very large errors can arise from misinterpretation of extinction debt, inappropriate functional form, and ignoring forest regeneration.

Although spatially explicit, these efforts examined few indicators of the spatial structure of the landscape. An existing model is modified here to represent a difference in niche adaptations as well as the competition-colonization tradeoff. Several landscape metrics are calculated at each iteration. Although the addition of niche differentiation did not change the qualitative outcome of the model, the spatial metrics show that some aspects of landscape structure, i.e., average patch area and proximity, become hyperdynamic and remain so.

Here I report the results from a natural field experiment using ""model"" bryophyte-based microlandscapes designed to follow the species richness dynamics of microarthropod communities postfragmentation. Community isolation due to fragmentation initiated a delayed community relaxation process and resulted in substantial local extinction. Over the period of the experiment z declined in the control communities and yet remained fairly stable in the fragmented communities.

We examined how local processes at the population level contribute to extinction debt, and how cycles of habitat deterioration and recovery may delay extinction. We carried out a demographic analysis of the fate of the grassland perennial Primula veris after the cessation of grassland management, where we used either a unidirectional succession model for forest habitat or a rotation model with a period of forest growth followed by a clear-cut and a new successional cycle. The simulations indicated that P. veris populations may have an extinction time of decades to centuries after a detrimental management change. A survey of the current incidence and abundance of P. veris in sites with different histories of afforestation confirmed the simulation results of low extinction rates. P. veris had reduced incidence and abundance only at sites with at least 100 years of forest cover. Time to extinction in simulations was dependent on the duration of the periods with favourable and unfavourable conditions after management cessation, and the population sizes and growth rates in these periods. Our results thus suggest that the ability of a species to survive is a complex function of disturbance regimes, rates of successional change, and the demographic response to environmental changes. Detailed demographic studies over entire successional cycles are therefore essential to identify the environmental conditions that enable long-term persistence and to design management for species experiencing extinction debts.",NA,NA,"2016","SPRINGER","2016 MAY","OECOLOGIA","181","1","125","135","10.1007/s00442-016-3569-6","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000374564000012","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lehtila, Kari et al.

In central Texas savannas, woody plant encroachment reduces the amount of habitat available to herbaceous species while fragmenting remaining habitat. We examined the relationships between present species richness and present and past habitat amount and fragmentation (measured as fractal dimension) using a series of aerial photographs taken over nearly 60 years. We show that woody plant encroachment, a common phenomenon in savannas worldwide, reduces the diversity of herbaceous vegetation through both habitat loss and fragmentation. Habitat loss has the strongest impact on species richness over short time spans and small spatial scales in these savannas. Habitat fragmentation, however, has the strongest impact over longer time spans and larger spatial scales and generates long-term extinction debts.

The target group are the arthropods, and the main habitat the Laurisilva, the Azorean native forest. Diversification of Azorean arthropod species is affected by island age, area and isolation. However, results obtained for over a decade show that distinct groups are differently affected by these factors, which has lead to the extreme diverse distribution patterns currently observed. Spatial distribution of arthropods in each island may be interpreted as caused by a typical ""mass effect"", with many species following a ""source-sink"" dynamics. Truly, regionally rare species are those that are habitat specialists, many of them being threatened endemic species. Although various endemics persist as sink populations in human-made habitats (e.g., exotic forests), more than half of the original endemic forest arthropods may already have vanished or may eventually be driven to extinction in the future.

During the past 50 years, government supported, commercial fishing has resulted in the collapse of about a thousand populations that once supplied most of the world's seafood. For the collapsed species, now existing as small remnants of their former population sizes, the future is bleak. They suffer from loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and depensation. Because marine species were eliminated by historic climatic changes, continued global warming is likely to result in the extinction of small populations that already have a precarious existence. They may be considered evidence of an extinction debt that must be paid as the climate change becomes more severe.

To formulate a simple mechanistic model using neutral theory that links extinction debt with the species-area relationship (SAR).Location World-wide.Methods We use the neutral model of biodiversity to describe how a community subject to immigration responds to an insular contraction. We investigate the species richness at different times after the habitat-loss event. We compare this with observed species losses in avian studies.Results From the model, two SARs emerge: one with a shallow slope for a habitat area before habitat loss and another with a steeper slope for the habitats that remain after habitat loss. From these curves, the first predicts imminent extinctions while the second predicts total extinctions. The difference between the two curves gives the delayed extinctions, namely the number of species that are lost during the relaxation of the community to equilibrium. The model agrees well with observed relaxation rates in communities of birds. The lag times for relaxation are often very large, with half-lives in the order of thousands of years for remnant areas above 5000 km(2). In many parameter combinations explored, the majority of extinctions are delayed extinctions, and may exceed imminent extinctions by orders of magnitude.Main conclusions Extinction debt is a major reason for failures to observe extinctions following habitat loss. Our modelling approach supports the view that a significant proportion of extinctions are delayed, so that the predictions of SARs (as currently applied) are liable to underestimate total extinctions.

Several authors have observed that spatial population systems behave like deterministic nonspatial systems if dispersal averages the dynamics over a sufficiently large scale. We exploit this fact to develop an exact series expansion, which allows one to derive approximations of stochastic individual-based models without resorting to heuristic assumptions. Our approach makes it possible to calculate the corrections to mean-field models in the limit where the interaction range is large, and it provides insight into the performance of moment closure methods.

Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. ""Good practice"" dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species, conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with flooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the long-term, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We specifically investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the >58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height >15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness <100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following largescale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output.

Differential models based on mean-field assumption and pair approximation and cellular automaton were built on metapopulation framework to reveal the effect of empty patches and multi-behavior strategies on persistence under habitat degradation. (1) The cooperators were always been excluded under mean-field assumption, showing that the coexistence of defective and cooperative behaviors is impossible in well-mixed population. (2) Metapopulation can survive even when colonization rate was lower than extinction rate, due to the compensation of cooperation rewards to extinction debt. (3) With the change of the temptation to defect and other parameters, metapopulation can be pure cooperators, pure defectors, and cooperator-defector coexistence (aggregated cooperators encircled by the defectors with relatively fixed borders). (4) Under habitat destruction, including patch isolation and habitat decay, metapopulation remains constant size through the self-regulation of cooperator-defector frequencies. The habitat improvement is always accompanied contradictorily with the behavioral degradation (more cheaters). Results and literature evidences lead to a stage-equilibrium hypothesis: multi-element system can maintain and stabilize its function and systematic level under environmental stress through the self-regulation of element proportions.

To minimize this threat, it is critical to understand what factors are influencing plant extinction rates. We compiled plant extinction rate data for 22 cities around the world. Two-thirds of the variation in plant extinction rates was explained by a combination of the city's historical development and the current proportion of native vegetation, with the former explaining the greatest variability. As a single variable, the amount of native vegetation remaining also influenced extinction rates, particularly in cities > 200 years old. Our study demonstrates that the legacies of landscape transformations by agrarian and urban development last for hundreds of years, and modern cities potentially carry a large extinction debt.

Whether such changes modify interactions between species and the networks in which they are embedded remain fundamental questions to assess the 'health' and ecosystem functionality of logged forests. We focus on interactions between lianas and their tree hosts within primary and selectively logged forests in the biodiversity hotspot of Malaysian Borneo. We found that lianas were more abundant, had higher species richness, and different species compositions in logged than in primary forests. Logged forests showed heavier liana loads disparately affecting slow growing tree species, which could exacerbate the loss of timber value and carbon storage already associated with logging. Moreover, simulation scenarios of host tree local species loss indicated that logging might decrease the robustness of liana-tree interaction networks if heavily infested trees (i.e. the most connected ones) were more likely to disappear. This effect is partially mitigated in the short term by the colonization of host trees by a greater diversity of liana species within logged forests, yet this might not compensate for the loss of preferred tree hosts in the long term. As a consequence, species interaction networks may show a lagged response to disturbance, which may trigger sudden collapses in species richness and ecosystem function in response to additional disturbances, representing a new type of 'extinction debt'.",NA,NA,"2016","ROYAL SOC","2016 MAR 16","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","283","1826",NA,NA,"10.1098/rspb.2015.3008","0962-8452 and 1471-2954","WOS:000374921900027","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Magrach, Ainhoa et al.

Quantitative genetic theory aims to predict critical rates of environmental change beyond which populations go extinct. Here, we point out that all current predictions effectively assume the same specific fitness function. This function causes selection on the standing genetic variance of quantitative traits to become increasingly strong as mean trait values depart from their optima. Hence, there is no bound on the rate of evolution and persistence is determined by the critical rate of environmental change at which populations cease to grow. We then show that biologically reasonable changes to the underlying fitness function can impose a qualitatively different extinction threshold. In particular, inflection points caused by weakening selection create local extrema in the strength of selection and thus in the rate of evolution. These extrema can produce evolutionary tipping points, where long-run population growth rates drop from positive to negative values without ever crossing zero. Generic early-warning signs of tipping points are found to have little power to detect imminent extinction, and require hard-to-gather data. Furthermore, we show how evolutionary tipping points produce evolutionary hysteresis, creating extinction debts.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 DEC","EVOLUTION","71","12","2930","2941","10.1111/evo.13374","0014-3820 and 1558-5646","WOS:000417567000012","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Osmond, Matthew M. et al.

The landscape matrix plays a vital role in supporting species populations. However, the importance of the historical composition and configuration of landscape mosaics has received little attention, with studies focusing on the effects of loss and fragmentation of single (focal) habitat over time. We investigated the importance of historical and contemporary landscape heterogeneity (composition and configuration) to identify how landscape change has, and is continuing to have, an effect on current woodland carabid communities.Location: Lowland Britain.Methods: Carabids were sampled from woodlands in 36 tetrads of 4km(2). Ordination methods analysed current community response to representations of contemporary and historical (1930s) landscape heterogeneity. The effects of 80years of landscape change on current carabid assemblages were compared among tetrads.Results: Results are consistent with an extinction debt; carabid communities correlated significantly with the historical composition and configuration of the landscape, but not contemporary landscape configuration. Community assemblages have been shaped, and many species remain affiliated with landscape conditions that no longer exist, notably, large patches of broadleaf woodland and semi-natural grassland. Recent introduction of conifer plantations has had a negative effect on the abundance of many woodland species. For many common, slow-dispersing species, contemporary and historical landscapes offered sub-optimum woodland coverage indicating a lag effect that exceeds 80years. Increased arable land cover and loss of semi-natural grassland and heathland points towards an ongoing detrimental impact on carabid populations.Main conclusions: Compared with focal-habitat studies, the landscape mosaic approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of widespread landscape change on species communities. Conservation guidance includes new planting, maintenance and restoration of semi-natural habitats, implemented across multiple spatial scales and where feasible, considering both historical and contemporary landscape heterogeneity.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 DEC","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","23","12","1447","1458","10.1111/ddi.12652","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000414865500008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Neumann, Jessica L. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Jenkins, DG and Grissom, S and Miller, K","Consequences of prairie wetland drainage for crustacean biodiversity and metapopulations","Much of Illinois was once wet prairie, dotted with ancient (ca. 10,000-year-old) ephemeral wetlands. Most wetland habitat (85%) was converted to agriculture over a span of about 100 years (ca. 1850-1950). The consequences of this severe habitat fragmentation on wetland communities and metapopulations are unknown. We studied crustacean communities (weekly stovepipe samples throughout hydroperiods) for 3 years in a set of extant ephemeral wetlands in Illinois. We generated species-sites curves by rarefaction and extrapolated those curves to conservatively estimate that 83-85 crustacean species may have inhabited approximately 4 million ephemeral wetlands that once existed in Illinois; 8-9 crustacean species were driven to extinction in Illinois during drainage; and 75-76 crustacean species are extant in the few remaining ephemeral wetlands of Illinois. We also conducted cellular automata simulations to examine the potential effects of habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure of extant crustacean metapopulation. Simulations indicated that conversion of the former wet prairie to agriculture may have reduced crustacean metapopulations to isolated populations that are more vulnerable to future habitat loss. Despite severe habitat fragmentation, curvilinear species-sites relationships suggest that the greatest extinction rates have yet to occur for ephemeral wetland crustaceans. However, selection for limited dispersal during habitat fragmentation may contribute to extinction debt for extant species. Conservation programs can preserve much of the historical biodiversity of ephemeral wetlands, but future wetland biodiversity will depend heavily on the success of those efforts. The consequences of historical wetland loss and the importance of wetland conservation efforts to agriculture in the United States should be instructive for other regions.",NA,NA,"2003","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC","2003 FEB","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","17","1","158","167","10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01450.x","0888-8892","WOS:000180846200020","350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA","Article","MALDEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jenkins, DG et al.

There is increasing evidence for impacts of climate and other drivers on plant community change, and fragmented habitats are predicted to be much less resilient to negative impacts on biodiversity and other services. Within Europe, Scotland's native forests are highly fragmented and now cover 4% of the land after many centuries of degradation and loss, but little is known about how their species composition has changed. We recorded long-term vegetation change (from resurvey data) and examined the relationships with climate, pollutant deposition and grazing as key drivers of change, focusing on four forest types: pine, ash, acid- and base-rich oak birch. All four forest types showed dynamic compositional change during 30-50 years between surveys, with increased species richness and decreased diversity. There was no evidence for homogenisation - the opposite was the case for all except pine (no change). Analyses indicate significant and varied climate, pollution and grazing impacts; NHy deposition showed the most frequent association with species compositional changes. Notable species changes include increases in pteridophytes and declines in forb cover, and a doubling in frequency and cover of Fagus sylvatica between surveys. Our findings suggest a possible extinction debt, with many more species declining than increasing between surveys.

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Time period 30-0 thousand years before present (kybp). Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30-20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20-10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming) and 10-0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Main conclusions Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming.

A time delay may be involved in the regional extinction of species, and the number of species that eventually may go extinct in the future is called the ""extinction debt."" In boreal Sweden, we examined whether the number of epiphytic crustose lichens and wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth forest remnants diverges from species richness levels in forest patches that have been naturally isolated for millennia. An excess of species in forest remnants could indicate the presence of an extinction debt. Observed species richness in 32 old-growth forest remnants (also called woodland key habitats [WKHs]) was compared with predicted species richness. To predict species richness we used regression models based on data from 46 isolated old-growth forest patches in a forest-wetland matrix. The reference landscape is ancient and assumed to reflect the conditions of insular floras in dynamic equilibrium. Stand factors constituted predictive variables in the models. The observed number of lichen species was higher than expected (i.e., an extinction debt among lichens may exist). By contrast, there was no significant difference between observed and expected species richness among wood-inhabiting fungi. The species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi has adjusted to the changes in forest and landscape structure more rapidly than the species richness of lichens. Differences in substrate dynamics between epiphytes on living trees and species growing on decaying logs might explain the difference between species groups. The results also indicate that population densities of red-listed species were low, which may result in continuing extinctions of red-listed species. The importance of WKHs might be overvalued because species may be lost if conservation efforts consider only protection and preservation of WKHs.",NA,NA,"2005","WILEY","2005 APR","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","19","2","338","348","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00550.x","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000227647600011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Berglund, H et al.

Plantations, including different age classes and roadsides, maintained high native species richness at the landscape scale but supported a completely different community composition than natural forests. Thus, natural forest remnants must be conserved as plantations cannot replace them. Certain natural forest species occurred frequently in mature plantations and can represent starting points for retaining natural elements in plantations. Generalist native and alien species benefited from plantation management, mainly in young plantations and along roadsides. Stand maturation and a closed canopy, though, reduced alien species occurrences within plantations. Along roads, shade-tolerant aliens should be monitored and removed as they can potentially invade natural forests.

Unlike seedlings, saplings showed no declines in richness in fragments, suggesting that density dependent mortality (where rare individuals have a higher survival rate) and/or year-to-year variation in which species are recruiting could potentially compensate for the reductions in seedling richness we observed. Longer-term studies are required to determine whether sporadic or failed recruitment in small fragments will eventually translate into reduced richness of mature trees, or whether the processes that currently retain high sapling richness will continue in fragments.

X.","Demographic back-casting reveals that subtle dimensions of climate change have strong effects on population viability","The effects of climate change on population viability reflect the net influence of potentially diverse responses of individual-level demographic processes (growth, survival, regeneration) to multiple components of climate. Articulating climate-demography connections can facilitate forecasts of responses to future climate change as well as back-casts that may reveal how populations responded to historical climate change. We studied climate-demography relationships in the cactusCyclindriopuntia imbricata; previous work indicated that our focal population has high abundance but a negative population growth rate, where deaths exceed births, suggesting that it persists under extinction debt. We parameterized a climate-dependent integral projection model with data from a 14-year field study, then back-casted expected population growth rates since 1900 to test the hypothesis that recent climate change has driven this population into extinction debt. We found clear patterns of climate change in our central New Mexico study region but, contrary to our hypothesis,C. imbricatahas most likely benefitted from recent climate change and is on track to reach replacement-level population growth within 37 years, or sooner if climate change accelerates. Furthermore, the strongest feature of climate change (a trend towards years that are overall warmer and drier, captured by the first principal component of inter-annual variation) was not the main driver of population responses. Instead, temporal trends in population growth were dominated by more subtle, seasonal climatic factors with relatively weak signals of recent change (wetter and milder cool seasons, captured by the second and third principal components). Synthesis. Our results highlight the challenges of back-casting or forecasting population dynamics under climate change, since the most apparent features of climate change may not be the most important drivers of ecological responses. Environmentally explicit demographic models can help meet this challenge, but they must consider the magnitudes of different aspects of climate change alongside the magnitudes of demographic responses to those changes.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","108","6","2557","2570","10.1111/1365-2745.13471","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000562570800001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Czachura, Kevin et al.

Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.",NA,NA,"2018","SPRINGER","2018 JAN","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","27","1","217","233","10.1007/s10531-017-1430-9","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000419149800012","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lampinen, Jussi et al.

It has been suggested that epiphytes, whose host plants can be regarded as habitat patches, often form such patch-tracking populations. However, very little is known about the long-term fate of epiphyte individuals and populations. We estimated life span and assessed environmental factors influencing changes in vitality, fertility, abundance, and distribution of the epiphytic lichen species Lobaria pulmonaria on two spatial scales, individual trees and forest patches, over a period of; 10 years in 66 old-growth forest fragments.The lichen had gone extinct from 7 of the 66 sites (13.0%) where it was found 10 years earlier, even though the sites remained unchanged. The risk of local population extinction increased with decreasing population size. In contrast to the decrease in the number of occupied trees and sites, the mean area of the lichen per tree increased by 43.0%. The number of trees with fertile ramets of L. pulmonaria increased from 7 (similar to 1%) to 61 (similar to 10%) trees, and the number of forest fragments with fertile ramets increased from 4 to 23 fragments.The mean annual rate of L. pulmonaria extinction at the tree level was estimated to be 2.52%, translating into an expected lifetime of 39.7 years. This disappearance rate is higher than estimated mortality rates for potential host trees. The risk of extinction at the tree level was significantly positively related to tree circumference and differed between tree species. The probability of presence of fertile ramets increased significantly with local population size.Our results show a long expected lifetime of Lobaria pulmonaria ramets on individual trees and a recent increase in vitality, probably due to decreasing air pollution.

We discuss recent contributions made using these data sources to understanding the impacts of habitat disturbance and climate change on plant populations and communities, and the duration of extinction-colonization time lags in response to landscape change. Historical data frequently support inferences made using conventional ecological studies (e. g., increases in warm-adapted species as temperature rises), but there are cases when the addition of different data sources leads to different conclusions (e. g., temporal vegetation change not as predicted by chronosequence studies). The explicit combination of historical and contemporary data sources is an especially powerful approach for unraveling long-term consequences of multiple drivers of global change.

Although we have a general understanding of the negative consequences of habitat loss for biodiversity, much less is known about the resulting effects on the pattern of interactions in mutualistic networks. Ecological networks formed by mutualistic interactions often exhibit a highly nested architecture with low modularity, especially in comparison with antagonistic networks. These patterns of interaction are thought to confer stability on mutualistic communities. With the growing threat of environmental change, it is important to expand our understanding of the factors that affect biodiversity and the stability of the communities that provide critical ecosystem functions and services. We studied the effects of habitat loss on plant-pollinator network architecture and found that regional habitat loss contributes directly to species loss and indirectly to the reorganization of interspecific interactions in a local community. Networks became more highly connected and more modular with habitat loss. Species richness and abundance were the primary drivers of variation in network architecture, though species compositi n affected modularity. Theory suggests that an increase in modularity with habitat loss will threaten community stability, which may contribute to an extinction debt in communities already affected by habitat loss.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 DEC","ECOLOGY","94","12","2688","2696","10.1890/13-0977.1","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000328928300004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Spiesman, Brian J. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Gilbert, Benjamin and Levine, Jonathan M.","Plant invasions and extinction debts","Whether introduced species invasions pose a major threat to biodiversity is hotly debated. Much of this debate is fueled by recent findings that competition from introduced organisms has driven remarkably few plant species to extinction. Instead, native plant species in invaded ecosystems are often found in refugia: patchy, marginal habitats unsuitable to their nonnative competitors. However, whether the colonization and extinction dynamics of these refugia allow long-term native persistence is uncertain. Of particular concern is the possibility that invasive plants may induce an extinction debt in the native flora, where persistence over the short term masks deterministic extinction trajectories. We examined how invader impacts on landscape structure influence native plant persistence by combining recently developed quantitative techniques for evaluating metapopulation persistence with field measurements of an invaded plant community. We found that European grass invasion of an edaphically heterogeneous California landscape has greatly decreased the likelihood of the persistence of native metapopulations. It does so via two main pathways: (i) decreasing the size of native. refugia, which reduces seed production and increases local extinction, and (ii) eroding the dispersal permeability of the matrix between refugia, which reduces their connectivity. Even when native plant extinction is the deterministic outcome of invasion, the time to extinction can be on the order of hundreds of years. We conclude that the relatively short time since invasion in many parts of the world is insufficient to observe the full impact of plant invasions on native biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2013","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2013 JAN 29","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","110","5","1744","1749","10.1073/pnas.1212375110","0027-8424","WOS:000314558100039","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gilbert, Benjamin et al.

Previous studies on relict species have generally focused on glacial effects on narrow endemics; however, little is known about the effects of aridification on the fates of previously widespread subtropical lineages.Nuclear microsatellites and ecological niche modelling were used to understand observed patterns of genetic diversity in two emblematic species, widely distributed in these ecosystems: Canarina eminii (a palaeoendemic of the eastern Afromontane forests) and Canarina canariensis (a palaeoendemic of the Canarian laurel forests). The software DIYABC was used to test alternative demographic scenarios and an ensemble method was employed to model potential distributions of the selected plants from the end of the deglaciation to the present.All the populations assessed experienced a strong and recent population decline, revealing that locally widespread endemisms may also be alarmingly threatened.The detected extinction debt, as well as the extinction spiral to which these populations are subjected, demands urgent conservation measures for the unique, biodiversity-rich ecosystems that they inhabit.",NA,NA,"2018","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","2018 NOV 2","ANNALS OF BOTANY","122","6","1005","1017","10.1093/aob/mcy107","0305-7364 and 1095-8290","WOS:000455680200008","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mairal, Mario et al.

Then, we used simulated data sets to assess how ED varied when species lists used to derive species-area relationships had an increasing proportion of undetected species. When species lists were incomplete, ranging from 0.99 to 0.75, 15% fewer wetlands were estimated to have species in ED and, on average, 50% fewer species were expected to go extinct per wetland.

Energy transformation and biogeochemical cycle are two main ecosystem processes. The principle that spatial patterns affect ecological processes is the foundation of Landscape Ecology. Developmental activities cause habitat fragmentation. Two main effects of habitat fragmentation are: 1) the formation of isolated patches and 2) the increase in significance of 'edge effects'. A theory which links extinction debt with habitat destruction in meta-population models is presented. Species Ability to Forestall Extinction (SAFE), has been developed to help those actively involved in conservation efforts. It is built on the concept of minimum population size required by a species to survive in the wild, known as minimum viable population (MVP) size in the literature, and measures how close species are to their minimum viable population sizes.

The presence of some functional ecological plant species groups was correlated with patch configuration and age. Habitat quality, in terms of suitability for forest species, was found to be important in explaining the presence of species of high conservation value, but patch age (as an indicator for habitat quality) played a major role too. For core forest species, patch area is a redundant variable in explaining species richness relative to habitat quality and patch age and the extinction of specialists seems to occur mainly in a deterministic way. Even small forest fragments can be very important for maintaining plant species diversity, at least if they are of high habitat quality and if the forest management is appropriate.

Concurrently, novel habitats such as urban parks have been shown to be important as habitats and stepping stones in urban ecosystems around the world. However, few studies have assessed long-tenn patterns of species extinctions and discoveries in response to these drivers in the tropics. We know little about long-term persistence and utility of novel habitats in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we produced an updated and exhaustive butterfly checklist of species recorded from Singapore till December 2017 to investigate trends in butterfly extirpations (local extinctions), discoveries (new country records) and rediscoveries and how these relate to land use change in 28 years (1990-2017) in Singapore. Up to 144 butterfly species were identified to be extirpated in Singapore by 1990. From 1990-2017, an additional nine butterfly extirpations have potentially occurred, which suggests a maximum of 153 butterfly extirpations to date. The rate of extirpations between 1990 to 2017 (< 0.33 extirpations per year) was much lower than the rate of extirpations between 1926 to 1989 (> 1.52 extirpations per year). The majority of potentially extirpated butterflies between 1990 to 2017 were species restricted to mature forests. Over this period, 51 new species were discovered, while 65 species were rediscovered, which collectively represent 24% of the total and 35% of the extant butterfly fauna of Singapore. Interestingly, 33% of discovered species were only observed in degraded secondary forests or urban parks in Singapore, the former maturing with age and the latter having increased in area during the same time period. We hypothesise that the current slowdown in butterfly extirpations may be representative of habitat recovery and/or improved habitat connectivity, lower undetected extirpations, and/or lengthening of extinction debts.

O. and Kotiaho, Janne S.","Buffer strips can pre-empt extinction debt in boreal streamside habitats","Background: Conservation of biological diversity and economical utilization of natural resources form an almost inevitable confrontation between the two. In practice, however, a balance between the two ought to be found, and in managed boreal forests, preservation of woodland key habitats is increasingly used strategy to safeguard biological diversity. According to the Finnish Forests Act, certain Forest Act habitat (FAH) types must be safeguarded, provided they are clearly distinguishable from their surroundings. Furthermore, once the habitat has been identified as a FAH, its special characteristics must not be altered. Both of these aspects contain ambiguities that potentially undermine the practical application of the Act. We designed a replicated sampling study to address these ambiguities at the most common FAH type, riparian habitat of small boreal streams. As response variables we used vascular plants and mosses. We asked (i) how wide is the FAH around small streams that is distinguishable from its surrounding and (ii) how wide buffer strip around the FAH is sufficient for long term to preserve the natural species community composition of the FAH. Results: We found that an average three meters wide strip around the stream constitutes the distinguishable FAH and that a minimum of 45 meters wide buffers on both sides of the stream are needed for the species community composition to remain unaltered. Conclusions: We conclude that 45 meters wide buffers appear sufficient to safeguard vascular plant and moss species communities within the FAH, prevent local populations from extinctions and thus pre-empt extinction debt that would be realised with more narrow buffers. While 45 meters may seem intolerable from the commercial forestry point of view, anything less than that may be intolerable from the point of view of conservation, and thus against the idea of sustainable use of natural resources.",NA,NA,"2013","BioMed Central Ltd","2013 JUL 10","BMC ECOLOGY","13","24","(10 July 2013)","(10 July 2013)","10.1186/1472-6785-13-24","1472-6785","WOS:000321831400001","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Journal article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Selonen, Ville A.

Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global meta-analyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species. Beyond identifying literature biases, we highlight the research priorities and data gaps that need urgent attention and offer perspectives on how to move forward.",NA,NA,NA,"WILEY",NA,"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/gcb.15846","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000690746700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review and Early Access","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Davison, Charles W. et al.

Nonetheless, agroforests in the tropics often result from direct forest conversions, displacing rapidly vanishing and highly biodiverse forests with large carbon stocks, causing undesirable trade-offs. Scientists thus debate whether the promotion of agroforestry in tropical landscapes is a sensible policy. So far, this debate typically fails to consider land-use history, that is, whether an agroforest is derived from forest or from open land. Indeed, 57% of papers which we systematically reviewed did not describe the land-use history of focal agroforestry systems. We further find that forest-derived agroforestry supports higher biodiversity than open-land-derived agroforestry but essentially represents a degradation of forest, whereas open-land-derived agroforestry rehabilitates formerly forested open land. Based on a conceptual framework, we recommend to (a) promote agroforestry on suitable open land, (b) maintain tree cover in existing forest-derived agroforests, and (c) conserve remaining forests. Land-use history should be incorporated into land-use policy to avoid incentivizing forest degradation and to harness the potential of agroforestry for ecosystem services and biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 SEP","CONSERVATION LETTERS","13","5",NA,NA,"10.1111/conl.12740","1755-263X","WOS:000539868300001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Martin, Dominic Andreas et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Malanson, George P. and Wang, Qian and Kupfer, John A.","Ecological processes and spatial patterns before, during and after simulated deforestation","Theoretical and applied research on the ecological consequences of deforestation has focused on the remnants of habitat in relative isolation, but recent thinking has theorized more realistic conditions in which the areas of altered habitat are not completely destroyed, in which they recover and the connectivity of the landscape changes, and in which disturbance regimes play a role. A competition-colonization simulation, in which these primary 2006 tradeoffs are represented in a spatially explicit model, is used to explore the consequences of additional aspects of landscape dynamics following deforestation for plant diversity and community structure. The dynamics are analyzed in terms of temporal aspects of community resilience and changes in its spatial pattern. Simulations indicate that the initial degree of habitat alteration has little effect on resilience. Allowing succession to follow disturbance has a strong effect, which differs among species. Adaptation to an ongoing disturbance regime, which should improve resilience, is not evident when the disturbance itself continues. Deforestation changes the spatial pattern of the landscape, and species respond differently because of their different dispersal abilities. The species in turn alter the spatial pattern. The basic lessons of competition-colonization models for deforestation stand, but the ensured extinction implied by the extinction debt concept is further ameliorated as more realistic pattern-process relations are theorized.

We tested this hypothesis in southeast Sweden by analysing species occurrence per parish for twelve redlisted lichen species and nine redlisted fungus species in relation with current density of big oaks, the density of oaks in the 1830s and connectivity with parishes with the species present. For most species, the occurrence was positively related with current density of habitat (for 18 species out of 21) and parish area (for 16 species). Historical habitat density was positively related with occurrence for 11 species, while connectivity with current occurrences in the surroundings was positive for the occurrence of 12 species and negative for the occurrence of two. For lichen species the connectivity measure that best explained the variation was at a larger spatial scale as compared to fungus species. Even if the density of old oaks remains in the future, inhabiting species will most likely decline because their distribution patterns are not in equilibrium with the current habitat density. Therefore, to allow long-term persistence of inhabiting species the number of old oaks should be increased. Areas where such an increase is most urgent could be identified based on species occurrence data and current habitat density, but because species data will always be incomplete data on the historical habitat distribution is valuable.",NA,NA,"2008","SPRINGER","2008 SEP","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","17","10","2371","2381","10.1007/s10531-008-9387-3","0960-3115","WOS:000258085400005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ranius, Thomas et al.

In this review, we discuss how the genetic and demographic structure of fragmented populations of herbaceous forest plant species is affected by increased genetic drift and inbreeding, reduced mate availability, altered interactions with pollinators, and changed environmental conditions through edge effects. Reported changes in population genetic and demographic structure of fragmented plant populations have, however, not resulted in large-scale extinction of forest plants. The main reason for this is very likely the long-term persistence of small and isolated forest plant populations due to prolonged clonal growth and long generation times. Consequently, the persistence of small forest plant populations in a changing landscape may have resulted in an extinction debt, that is, in a distribution of forest plant species reflecting the historical landscape configuration rather than the present one. In some cases, fragmentation appears to affect ecosystem integrity rather than short-term population viability due to the opposition of different fragmentation-induced ecological effects. We finally discuss extinction and colonization dynamics of forest plant species at the regional scale and suggest that the use of the metapopulation concept, both because of its heuristic power and conservation applications, may be fruitful.",NA,NA,"2005","WILEY","2005 JUN","NEW PHYTOLOGIST","166","3","723","736","10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01352.x","0028-646X and 1469-8137","WOS:000228750700006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Honnay, O et al.

While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss versus fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985 to 2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by the past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss versus fragmentation studies.",NA,NA,"2021","ROYAL SOC","2021 JAN 13","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","288","1942",NA,NA,"10.1098/rspb.2020.2466","0962-8452 and 1471-2954","WOS:000608019100009","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Semper-Pascual, Asuncion et al.

We use metapopulations of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia in the United Kingdom as a model system to test for extinction debt in a declining species. We derive parameters for a metapopulation model (incidence function model, IFM) using information from a 625-km(2) landscape where habitat patch occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates for E. aurinia depend on patch connectivity, area, and quality. We then show that habitat networks in six extant metapopulations in 16-km(2) squares were larger, had longer modeled persistence times (using IFM), and higher metapopulation capacity (lambda(M)) than six extinct metapopulations. However, there was a >99% chance that one or more of the six extant metapopulations would go extinct in 100 years in the absence of further habitat loss. For 11 out of 12 networks, minimum areas of habitat needed for 95% persistence of metapopulation simulations after 100 years ranged from 80 to 142 ha (similar to 5-9% of land area), depending on the spatial location of habitat. The area of habitat exceeded the estimated minimum viable metapopulation size (MVM) in only two of the six extant metapopulations, and even then by only 20%. The remaining four extant networks were expected to suffer extinction in 15-126 years. MVM was consistently estimated as similar to 5% of land area based on a sensitivity analysis of IFM parameters and was reduced only marginally (to similar to 4%) by modeling the potential impact of long-distance colonization over wider landscapes. The results suggest a widespread extinction debt among extant metapopulations of a declining species, necessitating conservation management or reserve designation even in apparent strongholds. For threatened species, metapopulation modeling is a potential means to identify landscapes near to extinction thresholds, to which conservation measures can be targeted for the best chance of success.",NA,NA,"2007","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2007 JUL","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","17","5","1460","1473","10.1890/06-1032.1","1051-0761","WOS:000248265700016","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Bulman, Caroline R. et al.

Method: Species richness (= diversity) of the epiphyte lichen community known as Lobarion (named after Lobaria pulmonaria) was quanti. ed for 94 Populus tremula stands across Scotland, and compared in a predictive model to seven climate variables and eight measures of woodland structure. An optimum model was selected and used to project Lobarion diversity over the geographic range of the study area, based on IPCC climate change scenarios and hypothetical shifts in woodland structure.Results: Species diversity of the Lobarion community was best explained by three climate variables: (1) average annual temperature; (2) autumn and winter precipitation; in combination with (3) historic-woodland extent. Projections indicate a positive effect of predicted climate change on Lobarion diversity, consistent with the physiological traits of cyanobacterial lichens comprising the Lobarion. However, the general response to climate is modified significantly by the effect on diversity of historic- woodland extent.Conclusions: Historic- woodland extent may exert an important control over local climate, as well as impacting upon the metapopulation dynamics of species in the Lobarion. In particular, a temporal delay in the response of Lobarion species to changed woodland structure is critical to our understanding of future climate change effects. Future Lobarion diversity (e. g. in the 2050s) may depend upon the interaction of contemporary climate (e. g. 2050s climate) and historic habitat structure (e. g. 1950s woodland extent).

"DATA",NA,"Lampinen, Jussi","Data from: Disturbance, microclimate and historical habitat connectivity determine the population performance of the threatened grassland specialist Carex caryophyllea in remnant grasslands","Many grassland specialist plant populations in Europe have been restricted to remnant habitats. The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landsapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.

Although much emphasis has been placed on macrohabitats, suitable microhabitats are also vital for the survival of most species. The aim of this large-scale field experiment was to evaluate the relative importance of manipulated microhabitats, i.e., dead wood substrates of spruce (snags, and logs that were burned, inoculated with wood fungi or shaded) and macrohabitats, i.e., stand types (clear-cuts, mature managed forests, and forest reserves) for species richness, abundance and assemblage composition of all saproxylic and red-listed saproxylic beetles. Beetles were collected in emergence traps in 30 forest stands in 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2006. More individuals emerged from snags and untreated logs than from burned and shaded logs, but species richness did not differ among substrates. Assemblage composition differed among substrates for both all saproxylics and red-listed saproxylic species, mainly attributed to different assemblage composition on snags. This suggests that the practise of leaving snags for conservation purposes should be complemented with log supplementation. Clear-cuts supported fewer species and different assemblages from mature managed forests and reserves. Neither abundance, nor species richness or assemblage composition differed between reserves and mature managed forests. This suggests that managed stands subjected to selective cutting, not clear-felling, maintain sufficient old growth characteristics and continuity to maintain more or less intact assemblages of saproxylic beetles. Thus, alternative management methods, e. g., continuity forestry should be considered for some of these stands to maintain continuity and conservation values. Furthermore, the significantly higher estimated abundance per ha of red-listed beetles in reserves underlines the importance of reserves for maintaining viable populations of rare red-listed species and as source areas for saproxylic species in boreal forest landscapes.",NA,NA,"2012","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2012 JUL 25","Figshare","7","7",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0041100","1932-6203","DRCI:DATA2013078003546152","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Data study","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hjalten, Joakim et al.

We used a landscape-scale model of forest succession, wildfire, and C dynamics (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the effects of a changing climate (A2 and B1 IPCC emissions; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory General Circulation Models) on total forest C, tree species composition, and wildfire dynamics in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California, and Nevada. The independent effects of temperature and precipitation were assessed within and among climate models. Results highlight the importance of modeling forest succession and stand development processes at the landscape scale for understanding the C cycle. Due primarily to landscape legacy effects of historic logging of the Comstock Era in the late 1880s, C sequestration may continue throughout the current century, and the forest will remain a C sink (Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance>0), regardless of climate regime. Climate change caused increases in temperatures limited simulated C sequestration potential because of augmented fire activity and reduced establishment ability of subalpine and upper montane trees. Higher temperatures influenced forest response more than reduced precipitation. As the forest reached its potential steady state, the forest could become C neutral or a C source, and climate change could accelerate this transition. The future of forest ecosystem C cycling in many forested systems worldwide may depend more on major disturbances and landscape legacies related to land use than on projected climate change alone.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 NOV","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","19","11","3502","3515","10.1111/gcb.12310","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000325567100023","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loudermilk, E.

De-extinction, the process of resurrecting extinct species, is in an early stage of scientific implementation. However, its potential to contribute effectively to biodiversity conservation remains unexplored, especially from an evolutionary perspective.2. We review and discuss the application of the existing evolutionary conservation framework to potential de-extinction projects. We aim to understand how evolutionary processes can influence the dynamics of resurrected populations and to place de-extinction within micro- and macro-evolutionary conservation perspectives.3. In programmes aiming to revive long-extinct species, the most important constraints to the short-term viability of any resurrected population are (i) their intrinsically low evolutionary resilience and (ii) their poor eco-evolutionary experience, in relation to the absence of (co)adaption to biotic and abiotic changes in the recipient environment.4. Assuming that some populations of resurrected species can persist locally, they have the potential to bring substantial benefits to biodiversity if the time since initial extinction is short relative to evolutionary dynamics. The restoration of lost genetic information could lead, along with the reinstatement of lost ecological functions, to the restoration of some evolutionary patrimony and processes, such as adaptation and diversification.5. However, substantial evolutionary costs might occur, including unintended eco-evolutionary changes in the local system and unintended spread of the species. Further, evolutionary benefits are limited because (i) the use of resurrected populations as evolutionary proxies' of extinct species is meaningless; (ii) their phylogenetic originality is likely to be limited by the selection of inappropriate candidate species and the fact that the original species might be those for which de-extinction is the most difficult to achieve practically; (iii) the resurrection of a few extinct species does not have the potential to conserve as much evolutionary history as traditional conservation strategies, such as the reduction of ongoing species declines and extinction debts.6. De-extinction is a stimulating idea, which is not intrinsically antagonistic to the conservation of evolutionary processes. However, poor choice of candidate species, and most importantly, too long time scales between a species' extinction and its resurrection are associated with low expected evolutionary benefits and likely unacceptable eco-evolutionary risks.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 MAY","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","31","5","1021","1031","10.1111/1365-2435.12723","0269-8463 and 1365-2435","WOS:000400855300006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Robert, Alexandre et al.

Soil seed banks depend on on-site reproduction, seed longevity, and seed immigration for maintenance. When immigration of seeds is lost due to a change in land use or a disturbance, such as fragmentation, seed banks rely on on-site reproduction and longevity for maintenance. Within a fragment without seed immigration, seed banks become vulnerable to extinction debt leading to community disassembly over a long time scale. Therefore, we investigated how long-term fragmentation impacts community disassembly in seed banks. Seed bank samples were taken from grassland fragments (sod tables, n = 28) and from the surrounding area(matrix, n = 28). Seed banks were germinated, and emerging plants were identified. We found that community disassembly was not predictable in regard to species identity, and specialist (P < 0.001) and perennial (P < 0.001) species were lost from fragments. However, seed banks in fragments maintained a similar grass-to-forb ratio compared with the surrounding vegetation. Therefore, the ability of seed banks to provide ecological resilience may be limited after long-term fragmentation and land managers may need to reseed specialist species and perennials into grassland fragments.

Biologically, these changes include habitat destruction, biotic homogenization, increased species invasions, and accelerated extinctions [2]. Contemporary extinction rates far surpass background rates [3], but they seem remarkably low in plants [4, 5]. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed, and as a result, extinction rates may vary among regions. Some authors have contentiously argued that novel anthropic habitats and human-induced plant speciation can actually increase regional biodiversity [6, 7]. Here, we report on one of the most comprehensive datasets to date, including regional and global plant extinctions in both biodiversity hotspots (mostly from Mediterranean-type climate regions) and coldspots (mostly from Eurasian countries). Our data come from regions covering 15.3% of the Earth's surface and span over 300 years. With this dataset, we explore the trends, causes, and temporal dynamics of recent plant extinctions. We found more, and faster accrual of, absolute numbers of extinction events in biodiversity hotspots compared to coldspots. Extinction rates were also substantially higher than historical background rates, but recent declines are evident. We found higher levels of taxonomic uniqueness being lost in biodiversity coldspots compared to hotspots. Causes of plant extinctions also showed distinct temporal patterns, with agriculture, invasions, and urbanization being significant drivers in hotspots, while hydrological disturbance was an important driver in coldspots. Overall, plant extinctions over the last three centuries appear to be low, with a recent (post-1990) and steady extinction rate of 1.26 extinctions/year.",NA,NA,"2019","CELL PRESS","2019 SEP 9","CURRENT BIOLOGY","29","17","2912","+","10.1016/j.cub.2019.07.063","0960-9822 and 1879-0445","WOS:000484805400025","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","Article","CAMBRIDGE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Le Roux, Johannes J. et al.

A deforestation event today leads to a time-delayed future release of carbon, from the eventual decay either of forest products or of slash left at the site [2]. Similarly, deforestation often does not result in the immediate loss of species, and communities may exhibit a process of ""relaxation"" to their new equilibrium over time [3]. We used a spatially explicit land cover change model [4] to reconstruct the annual rates and spatial patterns of tropical deforestation that occurred between 1950 and 2009 in the Amazon, in the Congo Basin, and across Southeast Asia. Using these patterns, we estimated the resulting gross vegetation carbon emissions [2, 5] and species losses over time [6]. Importantly, we accounted for the time lags inherent in both the release of carbon and the extinction of species. We show that even if deforestation had completely halted in 2010, time lags ensured there would still be a carbon emissions debt of at least 8.6 petagrams, equivalent to 5-10 years of global deforestation, and an extinction debt of more than 140 bird, mammal, and amphibian forest-specific species, which if paid, would increase the number of 20th-century extinctions in these groups by 120%.

Decreasing genetic diversity and changing population structure can reduce plant fitness and influence the long-term persistence of populations. Dry calcareous grasslands in Estonia have witnessed a large decline in area within the last 80 years, but due to extinction debt, the species richness in these grasslands has not yet responded to this decline. In these calcareous grasslands, we studied genetic diversity, phenotypic performance and population characteristics of a common habitat-specialist grass, Briza media. A decrease in genetic diversity was associated with a decrease in plant reproductive output. In addition, we found that some fitness components of B. media showed a delayed response to landscape changes. Specifically, plant height and germination success were related to historical rather than to current landscape parameters, indicating a time-lagged response of plant performance to habitat fragmentation. Dependence on historical landscape structure may thus result in a future decline in population fitness even if habitat loss and fragmentation no longer continue. The documented effect of current environmental conditions, however, shows that fitness-related traits are already slowly adapting to the changing conditions. Our results indicate that even common habitat-specialist species can be susceptible to landscape changes and be threatened by decreased population performance in the future.",NA,NA,"2013","SPRINGER","2013 JUL","PLANT ECOLOGY","214","7","953","963","10.1007/s11258-013-0221-y","1385-0237 and 1573-5052","WOS:000321134600006","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Takkis, Krista et al.

Endemic plants have been eliminated from 96.5% of St Helena by habitat loss. There are eight recorded extinctions in the vascular flora since 1771 giving an extinction rate of 581 extinctions per million species per year (E/MSY). This is considerably higher than background extinction rates, variously estimated at 1 or 0.1 E/MSY. We have no information for plant extinctions prior to 1771 but applying the same extinction rate to the period 1502 to 1771 suggests that there may be around ten unrecorded historical extinctions. We use census data and population decline estimates to project likely extinction forward in time. The projected overall extinction rate for the next 200 years is somewhat higher at 625 E/MSY. However, our data predict an extinction crunch in the next 50 years with 4 species out of the remaining 48 likely to become extinct during this period. It is interesting that during a period when the native plant areas dropped to 3.5% of the original, the extinction rate appears to have remained shallowly linear with under 30% of the endemic flora becoming extinct. MethodsThe time to percent decline (TPD) figures (see above) were standardized by conversion to half-lives (time to 50% decline: TPD50) using a simple exponential function, i.e. t1/2=t/log1/2(Nt/N0), where t1/2is the half-life (TPD50), t is the time period over which populationdecline has been measured, and Nt/N0is the proportion of the population remaining after t. We use the exponential for the decline curves as this is a very common general form of decline curve (Di Fonzo et al., 2013). The TPD50 for a species is therefore assumed to be constant, following an exponential decay process. The TPD50 was then used in combination with the total number of mature individuals (NMI) to project changes in NMI forward in time.

Classically, the SAR has been argued in general to conform to a power-law relationship, and this form has been widely assumed in most applications in the field of conservation biology. Here, using nonlinear regressions within an information theoretical model selection framework, we included uncertainty regarding both model selection and parameter estimation in SAR modeling and conducted a global-scale analysis of the form of SARs for vascular plants and major vertebrate groups across 792 terrestrial ecoregions representing almost 97% of Earth's inhabited land. The results revealed a high level of uncertainty in model selection across biomes and taxa, and that the power-law model is clearly the most appropriate in only a minority of cases. Incorporating this uncertainty into a hotspots analysis using multimodel SARs led to the identification of a dramatically different set of global richness hotspots than when the power-law SAR was assumed. Our findings suggest that the results of analyses that assume a power-law model may be at severe odds with real ecological patterns, raising significant concerns for conservation priority-setting schemes and biogeographical studies.",NA,NA,"2008","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2008 OCT 7","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","105","40","15458","15463","10.1073/pnas.0803610105","0027-8424","WOS:000260360500045","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Guilhaumon, Francois et al.

The long-distance dispersal potential of present-day communities was positively associated with the amounts of grassland in the historical (1835, 1938) landscape, and with a long continuity of grazing management-but was not associated with the properties of the current landscape. The study emphasises the role of history as a determinant of the dispersal potential of present-day grassland plant communities. The importance of long-distance dispersal processes has declined in the increasingly fragmented modern landscape, and long-term persistent species are expected to play a more dominant role in grassland communities in the future.

All standard methods for finding wood-beetles were used, including many window traps and 170 wood mould samples. As a new method, from 1992 and later, fragments in wood mould in hollow trees were collected and determined to species in the laboratory. We found 74 red-listed wood-beetles, including 13 threatened species (categories EN and VU). The highest numbers of threatened wood-beetles were found on properties owned by the church or by the largest landowners. This was because old (>150 years), southern deciduous trees were largely absent on small farm properties. Recorded habitats in the study area for the red-listed species are given. Old hollow oaks Quercus robur, beeches Fagus sylvatica, small-leaved limes Tilia cordata, elms Ulmus glabra and big dead birches Betula spp. were the most important substrates for threatened species in the study area. These substrates, mainly old living trees but also standing dead trees, are also crucial habitats for species listed as possibly globally threatened and found in the study area: Corticeus fasciatus, Ptenidium gressneri, Plectophloeus nitidus, Oxypoda arborea, Gnorimus nobilis, Ampedus hjorti, Athous mutilatus, Procraerus tibialis, Xylophilus corticalis, Grynocharis oblonga, Cryptophagus fuscicornis, C. labilis, Latridius brevicollis, Mycetophagus populi, Hypulus quercinus. Mycetochara axillaris. Phloeophagus lignarius and P. thomsoni. Threats to the long-term survival of the red-listed species are discussed. The need for rapid habitat restoration to lower the ""extinction debt"" is stressed. This is especially urgent for features that have declined most since Linnaeus time, e.g. old sun-exposed oaks and other southern deciduous trees. The number of big dead spruces has probably increased in recent decades, and therefore species dependent on spruce are unlikely to be part of the extinction debt.",NA,NA,"2003",NA,"2003","Entomologisk Tidskrift","124","3","137","157",NA,"0013-886X","BCI:BCI200400016544",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Nilsson, Sven G. et al.

Michael","Spatial, temporal, and life history assumptions influence consistency of landscape effects on species distributions","Models describing relationships between landscape features and species distribution patterns often display inter-study inconsistencies. Identifying factors contributing to these inconsistencies is a vital step in clarifying the ecological importance of landscape features and synthesizing an effective knowledge base for use in conservation contexts. We examined the influence of several spatial, temporal, and life history assumptions on the outcomes of distribution versus landscape models (DLMs) relating wetland bird communities at 29 Massachusetts (USA) sites to independent urbanization, wetland, forest, and agricultural landscape gradients. We considered a bird specialization index as well as obligate and facultative species richness as response variables. Landscape gradients were quantified at 10 landscape extents (0-1000 m in 100 m increments) and three time periods (1971, 1985, 2005). Univariate models indicated that our specialization index showed: (1) the strongest response to landscape gradients at small extents (200 m); (2) a negative, threshold response to urbanization was superior to a linear fit; and (3) no evidence of time-lagged effects of landscape change. Interestingly, the form of our model (i.e. linear versus threshold) influenced the extent at which strongest effects were detected. Multivariate models relating the specialization index as well as obligate and facultative species richness to landscape gradients showed evidence of annual variability (i.e. composition, parameter estimates, and variability explained) that did not depend upon an organism's degree of specialization. Our results provide evidence that violations of common assumptions (e.g. selection of appropriate extent, lack of time-lagged effects, etc.) can impact the outcome of DLMs, which could lead to inter-study inconsistencies.",NA,NA,"2010","SPRINGER","2010 AUG","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","25","7","1085","1097","10.1007/s10980-010-9482-1","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000279592100008","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tavernia, Brian G. et al.

Changes of rock glacier vegetation would provide evidence of the importance of climate change impacts, as the limitation provided by physical disturbance could be overcome by plant responses to warming.We assess, through the resurvey of ten rock glaciers (six active, four inactive) in the Italian Central Alps, the vegetation changes in response to 25 years of climate warming. Vegetation was analyzed through the phytosociological method in 1995 and 2020 adopting the same field protocol for both surveys with 1208 releves. The relation with climate was assessed by multivariate analysis.Air warming occurred in the study area and vegetation changed both in active and inactive rock glaciers, with increases of species richness, cover, changes in floristic composition. After 25 years the differences between active and inactive rock glaciers persisted but with an appreciable decrease mainly due to the larger vegetation changes showed by active rock glaciers. The multivariate analysis confirmed the relation between vegetation changes and air warming. The observed vegetation changes were compatible also with the impact of the decrease of the physical disturbance limitation likely due rock glacier stabilization, in particular for the active rock glaciers located at lower elevations, while the opposite trend could be hypothesized for those at higher elevations. The changes of floristic composition allowed assess that a gap-filling process, instead of species upward migration, produced the vegetation changes, with species persistence coupled to the recruitment of new species from the neighbor communities. Persistence of climate warming in future could lead to vegetation homogenization and biodiversity loss due to the extinction debt of several alpine species.",NA,NA,"2021","ELSEVIER","2021 NOV","CATENA","206",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.catena.2021.105562","0341-8162 and 1872-6887","WOS:000688449100069","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cannone, Nicoletta et al.

Since the 1960s, the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) has undergone extensive declines in heavily urbanized southern California, where the range edge has rapidly contracted northward while shifting its cardinal orientation to an east-west trending axis. We studied the genetic structure and diversity of these frontline populations, tested for signatures of contemporary disturbance, specifically fire, and attempted to disentangle these signals from demographic events extending deeper into the past. Consistent with the genetic expectations of the abundant-center' model, we found that diversity, admixture, and opportunity for random mating increases in populations sampled successively further away from the range boundary. Demographic simulations indicate that bottlenecks in peripheral isolates are associated with processes extending tens to a few hundred generations in the past, despite the demographic collapse of some due to recent fire-flood events. While the effects of recent disturbance have left little genetic imprint on these populations, they likely contribute to an extinction debt that will lead to continued range contraction unless management intervenes to stall or reverse the process.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 JUL","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS","6","5","808","822","10.1111/eva.12067","1752-4571","WOS:000321896500006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Richmond, Jonathan Q. et al.

The focus of practical conservation is currently shifting from local stands to a landscape perspective, but few studies have tested the relative effect of different spatial and temporal scales for occurrence and persistence of species of conservation concern. We studied Red Data Book and Indicator species (the latter proposed to indicate presence of Red Data Book species) of vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes and wood-inhabiting fungi in 22 old temperate broadleaved forests in southern Sweden. We analysed at which scales these species respond to habitat proportion in surrounding landscape. The proportion of suitable habitat was measured at two temporal scales (present-day and historic) and at two spatial scales (about 0-1 km and 1-5 kin of study sites). Local density of Red Data Book species increased with increasing proportion of suitable habitat in the current landscape (within 1-5 km of study sites) while Indicator species were unaffected. The response to landscape differed between organism groups. Vascular plants (near significantly) and wood-inhabiting fungi showed a time delay of 120 years in their response, indicating a possible regional extinction debt. An appropriate minimum landscape scale for conservation of Red Data Book species in temperate broadleaved forests in Sweden seems to be about 5 kin (radius), but smaller landscapes may be important for vascular plants and wood-inhabiting fungi of conservation concern. In addition, restoration is urgent to counteract the effect of time delays in species responses to recent habitat loss. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

I synthesized published studies in order to estimate a global mean extinction rate and determine which factors contribute the greatest uncertainty to climate change-induced extinction risks. Results suggest that extinction risks will accelerate with future global temperatures, threatening up to one in six species under current policies. Extinction risks were highest in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and risks did not vary by taxonomic group. Realistic assumptions about extinction debt and dispersal capacity substantially increased extinction risks.

To determine whether these habitats also contribute to landscape-scale biodiversity, we estimated species richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity of plant, butterfly and bumblebee communities in 32 km(2) landscapes with or without power line corridors, and with contrasting areas of road verges. Landscapes with power line corridors had on average six more plant species than landscapes without power lines, but there was no such effect for butterflies and bumblebees. Plant communities displayed considerable evenness in species abundances both in landscapes with and without power lines and high and low road verge densities. We hypothesize that the higher number of plant species in landscapes with power line corridors is due to these landscapes having a higher extinction debt than the landscapes without power line corridors, such that plant diversity is declining slower in landscapes with power lines.

While many studies have tested the effects of landscape context on the species richness and composition of vascular plants, few have compared the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes on the same landscape. We sampled non-epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants in 184 plots to test whether three landscape context factors measured four years or four decades previously could predict bryophyte or vascular plant species richness and composition after accounting for local factors. Location Temperate forests and oak savannahs, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Methods We used model selection and comparisons to test the effects of surrounding road density, total amount of forest, and distance to the nearest forest edge on species richness, species richness of non-disturbance-associated species, and community composition after controlling for important local predictors including substrate availability and topography. Results The species richness of non-disturbance-associated vascular plants was lower in plots with greater surrounding historical road density, and perennial stayer bryophyte richness declined with increasing historical road density and lower historical forest amount, suggesting a potential extinction debt. Landscape context significantly affected total species richness and community composition of vascular plants, but not bryophytes.

We identified such habitats that sustain endemic fishes in the plains of North America. We also summarized threats to their conservation and identified remnant habitats that still harbor endemic fishes (refuges) based on post-1989 surveys. Major springs, smaller, spring-fed streams, larger rivers, and euryhaline habitats were associated with a total of 49 endemics. Endemism was attributable to climatic refugia associated with each habitat type and dispersal limitation among major river drainages and springs. Forty-one endemic fishes (84%) were declining or extinct. Dewatering, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation were main causes of declines, often present together. Pollution and non-native species were also threats in many cases. Evidence for 53 existing refuges was found. We considered 34 refuges to be ""high-quality"" because they harbored three or more endemics. Twenty of these (those with available data) maintained consistent streamflow regimes for at least 50 years up to 2009. Case studies suggest high stream length, more natural flow regimes, and fewer direct human impacts are features of high-quality refuges, but extinction thresholds are unquantified and extinction debts of refuges are unknown. Limited information on past extinctions suggests drought, a natural feature of the plains, combines with other threats to eliminate remnant endemic populations. Long-term conservation planning requires identification, protection, and restoration of high-quality refuges to reduce extinction risk, especially during future drought periods. Planning should be integrated with regional water resource planning, given scarcity of water in the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased urbanization manifests in a number of ways and sophisticated analyses of how species respond to urban environments are required before generalizations about the relative merits of either planning strategy should be made. We investigated how insectivorous bats respond to housing density (a measure of urbanization intensity) and a range of habitat variables by modelling the occupancy and activity of 12 species in Melbourne, Australia. In addition to species-level analyses, species were grouped into guilds (matrix', patch' or edge' species) depending on their ecomorphology and level of patch-dependency. Housing density (dwellings per hectare: dph) was the dominant explanatory variable of occupancy and activity of most species studied. Site occupancy probabilities of patch and edge species were reduced by half at housing densities of just 11-45dph depending on species, while their activity was halved at housing densities of 26-103dph. The activity of two matrix species also declined, but at higher housing densities (reducing by half at 45-79dph). Patch and edge species responded nonlinearly to tree cover at low housing densities, with peaks in occupancy and activity at 20-60%. This response broke down at medium housing densities, however, as most species were no longer present.Synthesis and applications. Occupancy probability and activity of almost all bat species studied were substantially reduced even at very low housing densities. Increasing tree cover had no positive effect on the occupancy and activity of patch and edge species once medium housing densities were reached. In order for land-sharing strategies to provide good habitat for patch and edge bat species housing densities would need to be so low as to be impractical in most urban planning contexts. By contrast, land-sparing with forested habitat remaining in 20% or more of the landscape could provide positive conservation outcomes for the species modelled here.

"JOUR",NA,"Lafuite, A. -S. and Loreau, M.","Time-delayed biodiversity feedbacks and the sustainability of social-ecological systems","The sustainability of coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) hinges on their long-term ecological dynamics. Land conversion generates extinction and functioning debts, i.e. a time-delayed loss of species and associated ecosystem services. Sustainability theory, however, has not so far considered the longterm consequences of these ecological debts on SESs. We investigate this question using a dynamical model that couples human demography, technological change and biodiversity. Human population growth drives land conversion, which in turn reduces biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services to agricultural production (ecological feedback). Technological change brings about a demographic transition leading to a population equilibrium. When the ecological feedback is delayed in time, some SESs experience population overshoots followed by large reductions in biodiversity, human population size and well-being, which we call environmental crises. Using a sustainability criterion that captures the vulnerability of an SES to such crises, we show that some of the characteristics common to modern SESs (e.g. high production efficiency and labor intensity, concave-down ecological relationships) are detrimental to their long-term sustainability. Maintaining sustainability thus requires strong counteracting forces, such as the demographic transition and land-use management. To this end, we provide integrative sustainability thresholds for land conversion, biodiversity loss and human population size - each threshold being related to the others through the economic, technological, demographic and ecological parameters of the SES. Numerical simulations show that remaining within these sustainable boundaries prevents environmental crises from occurring. By capturing the long-term ecological and socio-economic drivers of SESs, our theoretical approach proposes a new way to define integrative conservation objectives that ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet.

"JOUR",NA,"Cooke, Benjamin and Lane, Ruth","Re-thinking rural-amenity ecologies for environmental management in the Anthropocene","The migration of lifestyle-orientated landholders (amenity migrants) to rural landscapes is resulting in the production of new rural ecologies. To date, the future implications of these ecologies for environmental management have been framed largely in 'traditional' conservation biology terms, focusing on how we can conserve or restore natural environments to a past ecological benchmark. However, the Anthropocene provides an opportunity to critically examine how we can progress environmental management in a way that locates ecologies as emergent products of human-environment interaction through time. We extend from Tim Ingold's work on wayfaring to position people and plants in environmental management as cohabitants who are traversing a world that is continually in the making. We conducted qualitative research in the hinterlands of Melbourne, Australia, involving narrative interviews with landholders and walking their property with them, using a form of participant observation called the 'walkabout' method. We found that the conservation aspirations of amenity migrants were mediated by the landscape histories that were embodied in the plants they engaged with on their property. These embodied landscape histories served to structure the trajectory of ecological emergence in which landholders were a part. We develop the concept of 'landscape legacy' to explain how past actions and future aspirations come together in management practice to produce novel and often unanticipated ecologies. Landscape legacy grounds the Anthropocene in everyday environments, capturing the need to progress environmental management as a wild experiment in rural-amenity landscapes, focusing on ecological form, function, relationship and process.

We review the causes and consequences of decline in primate diversity in Africa and argue that the major causes of decline fall into four interrelated categories: deforestation, bushmeat harvest, disease and climate change. We go on to evaluate the rarity and distribution of species to identify those species that may be particularly vulnerable to threats and examine whether these species share any characteristic traits. Two factors are identified that suggest that our current evaluation of extinction risk may be overly optimistic; evidence suggests that the value of existing forest fragments may have been credited with greater conservation value in supporting primate populations than they actually have and it is clear that the extinction debt from historical deforestation has not being adequately considered.

We examined the share of semi-natural grasslands within the general grassland areas in boreal Europe. We reviewed research literature across the region to compile evidence on semi-natural grasslands and other semi-natural habitats, such as wooded pastures, in respect to a range of topics such as ecology, land-use change, socioeconomics, and production. We also explored drivers of the research agenda and outlined future research needs. Challenges are faced when defining and quantifying semi-natural habitats even across a restricted region. Agricultural development and other policies clearly impact the research agenda in various countries. There are recent signs of a shift from classical ecological studies toward more multidisciplinary and integrated research. To sufficiently address the threats faced by semi-natural habitats, political and research frameworks in the European Union should pay more attention to the social-ecological complexity inherent in their management and should support the engagement of various actors into participatory governance processes.

The model developed by Tilman et al. [Tilman, D., May, R.M., Lehman, C.L., Nowak, M.A., 1994. Habitat destruction and the extinction debt. Nature 371, 65-66] has become an important toot for analyzing persistence of species in habitats under destruction. However, most analysis and applications of this model have been limited to the studies of species richness and the order of extinction. In this paper, we address other important issues related to succession of species abundances. We are interested in how the abundance ranking (i.e., the ranking of species according to their relative abundances), the rank-abundance curve and the community diversity alter in habitats under destruction. We treat analytically the model of Tilman et al. and investigate three different scenarios. We consider that before destruction: (i) best competitors are most abundant; (ii) all species are equally abundant; (iii) poor competitors are most abundant. In each case, we have derived explicit expressions for equilibrium species abundances depending on proportion of destroyed sites. Then we follow analytically alteration in the initial abundance ranking, show complex patterns Of Succession of species abundances and consider transformations in the rank-abundance curve. We demonstrate patterns of self-organization in abundance distributions emerging as a response to habitat destruction. We show non-monotonic dependence of community diversity and community evenness on proportion of destroyed sites. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we study metapopulation persistence in river networks analysing stage-structured populations that exploit different dispersal pathways, both along-stream and overland. Using stability analysis, we derive a novel criterion for metapopulation persistence in arbitrarily complex landscapes described as spatial networks. We show how dendritic geometry and overland dispersal can promote population persistence, and that their synergism provides an explanation of the so-called `drift paradox'. We also study the geography of the initial spread of a species and place it in the context of biological invasions.

A small suite of endemic species showed no habitat preference and may represent a fauna living in relatively open conditions prior to human occupation. Within forests, congeneric species frequently occur in the same site. All seven endemic Oxychilus species recorded occurred in a single site; there is no evidence of allopatric replacement or restricted distribution other than that imposed by habitat.

Secondary forests may provide relevant ecosystem services such as landscape defragmentation, biodiversity conservation, control of hydrological cycling and carbon sequestration. Secondary forests may benefit from the legacies of the former agricultural land use, and exhibit enhanced growth. Moreover, they may differ from long-established forests in terms of tree species composition and diversity, as community composition has been less modified by succession or management. However, we lack evidence whether the effects of land use legacies on tree species diversity may also result in differences in the response of secondary forests to biotic and abiotic disturbances. We aimed to evaluate the effects of land use legacies on taxonomic and functional diversity and their effects on the response of temperate broadleaf forests to drought and herbivory damage. For this aim, we compared secondary beechFagus sylvaticaforests established after 1950 in abandoned pastures with long-established (pre-1950) forests. We calculated indices of taxonomic and functional diversity and determined mean growth and growth response of beech to two drought events (1991, 2006), and insect herbivory damage. Secondary and long-established beech forests marginally differed in species richness but the former exhibited a significantly higher Shannon diversity index and evenness. Yet, differences in taxonomic diversity did not result in differences in functional diversity between forest types. Mean tree growth was higher in secondary than in long-established forests and it increased with functional diversity in both forest types. However, diversity was unrelated with the growth response to drought. Insect herbivory damage decreased with increasing functional diversity but only in secondary forests. Synthesis and applications. Promoting functional diversity in temperate broadleaf forests is a promising strategy for enhancing productivity (tree growth) while increasing the ability to cope with biotic disturbances (insect herbivory). This principle should be applied both in the management of long-established as well as expanding secondary forests. Yet, functional diversity does not seem to ameliorate tree response to drought, highlighting the need for other silvicultural practices to address this environmental challenge.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 DEC","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","57","12","2362","2372","10.1111/1365-2664.13728","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000559901300001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Espelta, Josep Maria et al.

Yet many primary forest patches remain unmapped, and it is unclear to what extent they are effectively protected. Our aim was to (1) compile the most comprehensive European-scale map of currently known primary forests, (2) analyse the spatial determinants characterizing their location and (3) locate areas where so far unmapped primary forests likely occur.LocationEurope.MethodsWe aggregated data from a literature review, online questionnaires and 32 datasets of primary forests. We used boosted regression trees to explore which biophysical, socio-economic and forest-related variables explain the current distribution of primary forests. Finally, we predicted and mapped the relative likelihood of primary forest occurrence at a 1-km resolution across Europe.ResultsData on primary forests were frequently incomplete or inconsistent among countries. Known primary forests covered 1.4 Mha in 32 countries (0.7% of Europe's forest area). Most of these forests were protected (89%), but only 46% of them strictly. Primary forests mostly occurred in mountain and boreal areas and were unevenly distributed across countries, biogeographical regions and forest types. Unmapped primary forests likely occur in the least accessible and populated areas, where forests cover a greater share of land, but wood demand historically has been low.Main conclusionsDespite their outstanding conservation value, primary forests are rare and their current distribution is the result of centuries of land use and forest management. The conservation outlook for primary forests is uncertain as many are not strictly protected and most are small and fragmented, making them prone to extinction debt and human disturbance.

"JOUR",NA,"Thom, Dominik and Rammer, Werner and Seidl, Rupert","Disturbances catalyze the adaptation of forest ecosystems to changing climate conditions","The rates of anthropogenic climate change substantially exceed those at which forest ecosystems - dominated by immobile, long-lived organisms - are able to adapt. The resulting maladaptation of forests has potentially detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, as many forest-dwelling species are highly dependent on the prevailing tree species, a delayed response of the latter to a changing climate can contribute to an extinction debt and mask climate-induced biodiversity loss. However, climate change will likely also intensify forest disturbances. Here, we tested the hypothesis that disturbances foster the reorganization of ecosystems and catalyze the adaptation of forest composition to climate change. Our specific objectives were (i) to quantify the rate of autonomous forest adaptation to climate change, (ii) examine the role of disturbance in the adaptation process, and (iii) investigate spatial differences in climate-induced species turnover in an unmanaged mountain forest landscape (Kalkalpen National Park, Austria). Simulations with a process-based forest landscape model were performed for 36 unique combinations of climate and disturbance scenarios over 1000 years. We found that climate change strongly favored European beech and oak species (currently prevailing in mid-to low-elevation areas), with novel species associations emerging on the landscape. Yet, it took between 357 and 706 years before the landscape attained a dynamic equilibrium with the climate system. Disturbances generally catalyzed adaptation and decreased the time needed to attain equilibrium by up to 211 years. However, while increasing disturbance frequency and severity accelerated adaptation, increasing disturbance size had the opposite effect. Spatial analyses suggest that particularly the lowest and highest elevation areas will be hotspots of future species change. We conclude that the growing maladaptation of forests to climate and the long lead times of autonomous adaptation need to be considered more explicitly in the ongoing efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services provisioning.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 JAN","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","23","1","269","282","10.1111/gcb.13506","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000390218300023","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Thom, Dominik et al.

Local floras are being depleted by a host of human activities, including habitat destruction and fragmentation, eutrophication, and the intensification of agriculture. Species with particular ecological demands or life-history attributes are more prone to extinction than species with a broader niche.2. We used an old herbarium from the municipality of Kusnacht (Swiss lowlands) as a historical record for comparison with contemporary plant diversity. This comparison revealed that 17% to 28% of all vascular plants that occurred between 1839 and 1915 were extinct by 2003.3. Species of different habitats and life-forms had significantly different rates of extinction: wetlands, disturbed sites and meadows lost most species, whereas forests and rocky habitats were least affected; aquatics and annuals were most prone to extinction, geophytes and hemicryptophytes were intermediate, and phanerophytes and chamaephytes were least affected.4. Species adapted to nutrient-poor soils suffered highest extinction in all habitats, indicating that eutrophication poses an urgent threat to species diversity. Light and soil moisture requirements also had significant effects on extinction, but the direction of the effect varied by habitat.5. When species were grouped into IUCN categories of the red list of Switzerland, the rank order of the observed extinction matched the red list assignment.6. Because many of the remaining species had high estimated extinction probabilities and because extinction is often delayed (extinction debt), a substantial part of the remaining flora of Kusnacht is likely to go extinct in the near future. This will increase the dominance of the common species that already comprise 81% of the local flora.7. The rates and patterns of extinction in Kusnacht are probably representative of surrounding Swiss lowlands and peri-urban landscapes in most developed countries.

Their continued loss through deforestation and agriculture is the main threat to species globally, more than disease, invasive species, and climate change. However, not all tropical forests have the same ability to sustain biodiversity. Those that have been disturbed by humans, including forests previously cleared and regrown (secondary growth), have lower levels of species richness compared with undisturbed (primary) forests. The difference is even greater considering extinctions that will later emanate from the disturbance (extinction debt). Here, we find that Haiti has less than 1% of its original primary forest and is therefore among the most deforested countries. Primary forest has declined over three decades inside national parks, and 42 of the 50 highest and largest mountains have lost all primary forest. Our surveys of vertebrate diversity (especially amphibians and reptiles) on mountaintops indicates that endemic species have been lost along with the loss of forest. At the current rate, Haiti will lose essentially all of its primary forest during the next two decades and is already undergoing a mass extinction of its biodiversity because of deforestation. These findings point to the need, in general, for better reporting of forest cover data of relevance to biodiversity, instead of ""total forest"" as defined by the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization.

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location: Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts Time period: 30-0 thousand years before present (kybp) Major taxa studied: Vascular plants Methods: Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30-20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20-10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming), and 10-0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results: Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0 â°C x10-4 yr-1) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2 â°C x10-4 yr-1) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Conclusions: Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming. Consistent patterns from different midden series across the region support a metacommunity model in which dispersal interacts with environmental filters and buffers against local extinction to drive community-climate disequilibrium during and after periods of warming.

The concept 'recovery debt', clearly a close relative of the ecosystem service debt, and gave it significance as 'the interim reduction of biodiversity and biogeochemical functions occurring during ecosystem recovery'. What the recovery debt really quantifies is the interim deviation rather than reduction of biodiversity and ecosystem functions from undisturbed state. These two are obviously very different things. The ambiguity seems to be reflected in the way the recovery debt values are constantly referred as 'reductions' or 'deficits' of biodiversity and functions. However, the reason why all the data appear as reductions is the inverse-transformation.

Relative persistence was related to species endemism, commonness, occurrence at its border of the global distribution range, main habitat type, sensitivity to human impact, life-form, conservation category, and Red List category. A literature-based database of the flora of Estonian habitat types was used to evaluate relative persistence of the flora of different habitats. Changes in the flora are largely dependent on human activities. The decrease in mire and grassland habitats and the increase in forests are reflected in the persistences of related species. Flora of mire habitats decreased the most. The fact that an almost ten-fold decrease of grasslands has not resulted in as large a decrease in the ranges of grassland species could serve as evidence of the extinction debt of these habitats. We also found a greater decrease among habitat specialists than habitat generalists and lower average persistence of the species of species-rich habitats. Our data show that current prioritization of species for conservation is in concordance with needs, as reflected in the changes in the range of species. However, conservation has not been entirely successful: the decrease of protected species continues. Our simple method for summarizing large databases was effective for the evaluation of large scale effects of conservation actions.",NA,NA,"2008","SPRINGER","2008 DEC","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","17","14","3531","3550","10.1007/s10531-008-9393-5","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000260938000015","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Review","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Sammul, Marek et al.

However, those that relate species density - the number of species within a standardized area - with fragment area (D-SAR) or isolation (D-SIR) have not been sufficiently explored, despite the potential for such an analysis to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of SARs and SIRs. Previous spatial theory predicts that a significant D-SAR or D-SIR is unlikely to emerge in taxa with high dispersal limitation, such as plants. Furthermore, a recent model predicts that the detection and the significance of D-SARs or D-SIRs may decrease with grain size. We combined a literature review with grain size-dependent sampling in a fragmented landscape to evaluate the prevalence and grain size-dependent nature of D-SARs and D-SIRs in plants. Location Worldwide (review) and a semi-arid agro-ecosystem in Israel (case study). Methods We combined an extensive literature review of 31 D-SAR studies of plants in fragmented landscapes with an empirical study in which we analysed grain size-dependent D-SARs and D-SIRs using a grain size-dependent hierarchical sampling of species density and species richness in a fragmented, semi-arid agro-ecosystem. Results We found that significantly increasing D-SARs are rare in plant studies. Furthermore, we found that the detection of a significant D-SAR is often possible only after the data have been stratified by species, habitat or landscape characteristics. The results from our case study indicated that the significance and the slopes of both D-SARs and D-SIRs increase as grain size decreases. Main conclusions These results call for a careful consideration of scale while analysing and interpreting the responses of species richness and species density to fragmentation. Our results suggest that grain size-dependent analyses of D-SARs and D-SIRs may help to disentangle the mechanisms that generate SARs and SIRs and may enable early detection of the effects of fragmentation on plant biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2014","WILEY","2014 JUN","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY","41","6","1055","1069","10.1111/jbi.12299","0305-0270 and 1365-2699","WOS:000335704500003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Giladi, Itamar et al.

The Eastern Arc forests are, as are many other tropical biodiversity hotspots, highly fragmented. Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat loss and subdivision) on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests is important because forest spatial structure highly influences species richness, persistence, and extinction debt. Here we examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests at a patch scale using very high resolution aerial imagery having a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.5 m. Forest area across the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains is 405,852 ha and is distributed into 311 fragments 10 ha in size with a median fragment size of 84 ha. The 18 largest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains contain greater than three-quarters of total forest area. Average fragment isolation, as assessed by median distance to nearest fragment and median distance to the nearest larger fragment, is 867 and 1533 m, respectively. Of total forest area, 14% is < 100 m from the forest edge and 33% is < 300 m from the forest edge. Establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments through forest regeneration and protection of secondary regenerating forest as well as providing protected area status to the remaining non-protected forest including unprotected smaller forest fragments are important to enhancing the long-term persistence of many plant and animal species here.",NA,NA,"2018","SPRINGER","2018 MAY","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","27","6","1387","1402","10.1007/s10531-018-1498-x","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000428552900005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Newmark, William D. et al.

We combined a re-sampling study in semi-permanent floodplain grassland plots with a GIS-based analysis of historical (1950s/1960s) and recent landscape patterns. Based on historical and recent vegetation maps and relev,s from six study areas (plus a protected reference area) covering 50-60 years of vegetation change following agricultural intensification, we aimed at analysing the importance of fragmentation on the diversity of potentially sensitive specialist species of wet floodplain meadows in northern Germany. On the plot scale, we found 30-66 % reductions in species richness of these characteristic wet meadow plant species over time and an associated increase in the fragmentation of grassland habitats. Distance to the nearest suitable habitat had a modest negative effect on modern plot-scale richness, while the other tested landscape metrics (total meadow area, mean patch size and landscape proximity index distribution) had no significant influence. There was also no evidence for a legacy of historical landscape structure on current richness of specialist species. Instead, management intensity and its change over the past decades, as indicated by altered Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients and moisture, had a strong influence on plot-scale diversity. The results suggest that fragmentation is not the proximate cause of impoverishment and point to habitat deterioration as a main driver. We conclude that conservation measures in Central-European floodplain meadows should not only focus on large continuous grassland areas, but should also consider small meadow patches if they remained species-rich.",NA,NA,"2015","SPRINGER","2015 SEP","FOLIA GEOBOTANICA","50","3","253","266","10.1007/s12224-015-9220-1","1211-9520 and 1874-9348","WOS:000361881100007","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Krause, Benjamin et al.

Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

To compensate for the negative ecological impacts of fire elimination, prescribed burning of forests as a restoration method has been introduced recently. We studied the effects of controlled burning on assemblages of wood-decaying polypores (Basidiomycota), including red-listed species, in a large-scale field experiment in Finland. A total of 24 forest sites were included in the factorial study design with two factors: logging and burning. The presence of polypore fruiting bodies was documented 1 year before the treatments, and 1 and 4 years after the treatments. Over 11 000 observations of 104 species of polypores were made. Change in the fungal species composition due to logging and burning was clear after 4 years. At the species level, the responses to logging and fire varied depending on the species. Treatments increased fruiting of pioneer decayers; however, most red-listed species seemed to suffer. Thus, prescribed burning does not offer immediate benefits for most red-listed species. In unlogged forests, the restorative effects of fire are likely to be seen later as the death and decay processes of trees continue and provide more resources for polypores.",NA,NA,"2008","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING","2008 FEB","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH","38","2","202","215","10.1139/X07-145","0045-5067 and 1208-6037","WOS:000253774000004","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","Article","OTTAWA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Junninen, Kaisa et al.

Me studied the effects of green-tree retention and controlled burning on red-listed and rare, deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles in a large-scale field experiment in eastern Finland. Our factorial study design included 24 sites dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and with three levels of green-tree retention (0, 10, and 50 m(3)/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned in 2001. We sampled beetles with 10 flight-intercept traps on each site during the years 2000-2002 (i.e., 1 pretreatment and 2 post-treatment years). A total sample of 153,449 individuals representing 1, 160 beetle species yielded 2,10 7 specimens of 84 red-listed or rare saproxylic species, The richness of these species was higher on the burned than on the unburned sites, and higher levels of green-tree retention promoted species richness, but there were clear differences between the years. The richness of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased in the first post-treatment year evidently due to the treatments, continued to increase on the burned sites in the second post-treatment year but decreased on the unburned sites. Our results showed that the living conditions of many red-listed and rare saproxylic species could be improved significantly with rather simple alterations to forest management methods.

In dynamic landscapes, most studies measure connectivity at multiple time steps, but pay less attention to explicitly quantifying its temporal dynamics to gain insights into its role in biodiversity patterns, thereby enabling more effective operational outcomes. Objectives This article aimed at making an overview of the existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity. By analysing their differences and possible applications, we aimed to highlight knowledge gap and future research directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature dealing with the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity and obtained 32 studies. Results We presented two main approaches based on graph theory and compared them from conceptual and operational perspectives. The first widely used approach, accounting only for the spatial dispersal of organisms, quantifies temporal changes in spatial connectivity. Based on two or multiple time steps in the time series, this approach enables assessment of the sense and magnitude of the temporal changes in spatial connectivity. The second recently developed approach quantifies spatio-temporal connectivity, thus accounting for both spatial and temporal dispersal. So far, this holistic assessment of spatio-temporal connectivity only covers two time steps. Conclusion Existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity provide indicators to advance our understanding of biodiversity patterns, and to be able to implement measures to conserve and restore connectivity.

Stream biodiversity may not respond to deforestation in a simple linear relationship. Rather, threshold responses to extent and timing of deforestation may occur. Identification of critical deforestation thresholds is needed for effective conservation and management. We tested for threshold responses of fish species and functional groups to degree of watershed and riparian zone deforestation and time since impact in 75 streams in the western Brazilian Amazon. We used remote sensing to assess deforestation from 1984 to 2011. Fish assemblages were sampled with seines and dip nets in a standardized manner. Fish species (n = 84) were classified into 20 functional groups based on ecomorphological traits associated with habitat use, feeding, and locomotion. Threshold responses were quantified using threshold indicator taxa analysis. Negative threshold responses to deforestation were common and consistently occurred at very low levels of deforestation (<20%) and soon after impact (<10 years). Sensitive species were functionally unique and associated with complex habitats and structures of allochthonous origin found in forested watersheds. Positive threshold responses of species were less common and generally occurred at >70% deforestation and >10 years after impact. Findings were similar at the community level for both taxonomic and functional analyses. Because most negative threshold responses occurred at low levels of deforestation and soon after impact, even minimal change is expected to negatively affect biodiversity. Delayed positive threshold responses to extreme deforestation by a few species do not offset the loss of sensitive taxa and likely contribute to biotic homogenization.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 AUG","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","32","4","860","871","10.1111/cobi.13061","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000438200100012","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brejao, Gabriel L. et al.

This is despite the fact that during the past 150 or so years the forests have shrunk to 13% or less of their original extent, very little of which in pristine condition. The 34 species not recorded during the study period mainly belong to genera and species-groups that are rare, local, or difficult of access-species that any collector would be lucky to find once in a lifetime. A few may actually be ""phantom species"" or mislabelled butterflies from other parts of Africa. Effectively it seems that no butterfly has yet gone regionally extinct in West Africa. Two-thirds of the 34 species not recorded between 1990 and 2006 were found elsewhere in Africa. This should be a source of pride and encouragement for all concerned with nature conservation in the region. The long-term survival of fauna and flora is wholly dependent on the continued existence of sufficient broadleaf forest in reasonable condition. It is possible that accumulated ""extinction debt"" will still lead to loss of species, a process that should be closely monitored.

The signs of past human forest use declined as a function of distance from villages. We found that the closest forests were 130 yr old or younger and contained very few elements typical of natural forests. Forests at a distance of between 1 and 1.5 km were older than 150 yr but showed marks of selective cuttings and had a less complete continuum of dead wood than forests that were 2-2.5 km from the villages. The most remote stands, which were generally older than 200 yr, predominantly had no signs of past forest use and had the most diverse dead wood composition.

We develop a mathematical framework derived from the multispecies metapopulation model of Tilman et al (1994) to study the dynamics of heterogeneous stem cell metapopulations. In addition to normal stem cells, the model can be applied to cancer cell populations and their response to treatment. In our model disturbances may lead to expansion or contraction of cells with distinct properties, reflecting proliferation, apoptosis, and clonal competition. We first present closed-form expressions for the basic model which defines clonal dynamics in the presence of exogenous global disturbances. We then extend the model to include disturbances which are periodic and which may affect clones differently.

Species richness of large coffee shade trees (>20 cm in diameter) was higher in larger patches with even slightly better fit of the statistical models when the historical area was taken into account. However, most species of large trees also occurred as seedlings showing that there is still a potential to conserve these species in the patches. Coffee management negatively affected the richness and density of woody species, especially in the intermediate size class (1.6-20 cm diameter). Disturbances accompanying coffee management such as slashing of the ground vegetation also negatively affected tree seedling density as well as species richness. There was no effect of connectivity on species richness. Based on the combination of these results we conclude that small patches of semi-forest coffee had fewer species of large trees, not because of a lack of tree seedlings, but probably because of differentiated local extinctions, perhaps during the time when the species were intermediate sized. To maintain the species richness of large trees in semi-forest coffee patches, the sites need to be actively managed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

"JOUR",NA,"Hanski, I and Ovaskainen, O","Extinction debt at extinction threshold","To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II. Ignoring time delays in population and metapopulation dynamics will lead to an underestimate of the number of effectively endangered species.",NA,NA,"2002","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC","2002 JUN","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","16","3","666","673","10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00342.x","0888-8892","WOS:000175832000015","350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA","Article","MALDEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hanski, I et al.

Vegetation and environmental data were collected in 84 plots from forests varying in intensity of coffee management. After controlling for environmental variation (altitude, aspect, slope, soil nutrient availability, and soil depth), differences in woody species composition, forest structure, and regeneration potential among management systems were compared using one way analysis of variance. The study showed that intensification of forest coffee cultivation to maximize coffee production negatively affects diversity and structure of Ethiopian moist evergreen Afromontane forests. Intensification of coffee productivity starts with the conversion of forest coffee to semiforest coffee, which has significant negative effects on tree seedling abundance. Further intensification leads to the conversion of semiforest to semiplantation coffee, causing significant diversity losses and the collapse of forest structure (decrease of stem density, basal area, crown closure, crown cover, and dominant tree height). Our study underlines the need for shade certification schemes to include variables other than canopy cover and that the loss of species diversity in intensively managed coffee systems may jeopardize the sustainability of coffee production itself through the decrease of ecosystem resilience and disruption of ecosystem services related to coffee yield, such as pollination and pest control.",NA,NA,"2013","SPRINGER","2013 MAR","ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","51","3","801","809","10.1007/s00267-012-9976-5","0364-152X and 1432-1009","WOS:000315416900022","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hundera, Kitessa et al.

We use a broad range of data and a review of the literature to show that the effectiveness of existing, and the current pace of the establishment of new, protected areas will not be able to overcome current trends of loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Despite local successes of well-designed and well-managed protected areas proving effective in stemming biodiversity loss, there are significant shortcomings in the usual process of implementation of protected areas that preclude relying on them as a global solution to this problem. The shortcomings include technical problems associated with large gaps in the coverage of critical ecological processes related to individual home ranges and propagule dispersal, and the overall failure of such areas to protect against the broad range of threats affecting ecosystems. Practical issues include budget constraints, conflicts with human development, and a growing human population that will increase not only the extent of anthropogenic stressors but the difficulty in successfully enforcing protected areas. While efforts towards improving and increasing the number and/or size of protected areas must continue, there is a clear and urgent need for the development of additional solutions for biodiversity loss, particularly ones that stabilize the size of the world's human population and our ecological demands on biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2011","INTER-RESEARCH","2011","MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","434",NA,"251","266","10.3354/meps09214","0171-8630 and 1616-1599","WOS:000293532900021","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","Review","OLDENDORF LUHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mora, Camilo et al.

We investigated (1) whether species response to past land use (ancient versus recent forest) was consistent with species response to distance to present forest edge (core versus periphery) (2) what life-history traits explained plant response to distance to present edge and past land use (3) whether distance to past forest edge explained current species distribution better than distance to present forest edge.LocationTemperate forests in the northern half of France (80,000km(2)).MethodsLocal climate, soil and stand characteristics, past land use, and present and past landscape metrics were collected on 11,936 plots using National Forest Inventory data and historical maps from 1831. Logistic regressions were applied to determine the response patterns of 181 species to present and past landscape, while controlling for local habitat quality (soil, climate and stand).ResultsSpecies response to distance to present edge very well matched response to past land use. Plant traits related to colonization capacity explained species response to present edge and past land use. The spatial distribution of 42 species was better explained by distance to forest edge in 1831, 37 species were better explained by distance to present edge and 24 species were better explained by distance to present edge and past land use.Main conclusionsTwo mechanisms were responsible for the long-range periphery-to-core gradient: (1) past landscape and colonization processes and (2) present edge-related mechanisms. This suggests that plant community differences between periphery and core zones are thus related to dispersal limitation and not only to environmental filters.

The total number of individual fruiting bodies recorded in the plot was 1741, comprising 170 species. We used nested quadrats from four starting points in order to examine species richness. The relationship between the number of species and quadrat size was then analyzed, and three models commonly used to describe species area relationships were fitted to the data. We found that the logistic model satisfactorily described the species richness area curves irrespective of where in the plot we started sampling. The results indicated that, when the sampling area increases, species richness increases quickly at first and then the increase slows, becoming asymptotic.

We analysed whether size, isolation or habitat quality are most important for the species richness in a set of 50 dry grassland fragments in agricultural landscapes of eastern Austria. We studied two plant taxa (vascular plants, bryophytes) and 11 invertebrate taxa (gastropods, spiders, springtails, grasshoppers, true bugs, leafhoppers and planthoppers, ground beetles, rove beetles, butterflies and burnets, ants and wild bees). The species richness of three categories was analysed: (1) dry grassland specialist species, (2) all grassland species and (3) all species. We used regression and hierarchical partitioning techniques to determine the relationship between species richness and environmental variables describing patch size and shape, patch quality, landscape configuration and landscape quality. The area-isolation paradigm was only applicable for dry grassland specialists, which comprised 12% of all species. Richness of all grassland species was determined mostly by landscape heterogeneity parameters. Total species richness was highly influenced by spillover from adjacent biotopes, and was significantly determined by the percentage of arable land bordering the patches. When analysing all taxa together, species richness of dry grassland specialists was significantly related to historical patch size but not to current patch size, indicating an extinction debt. At the landscape scale, the variable 'short-grass area' was a better predictor than the less specific variable 'area of extensively used landscape elements'. 'Distance to mainland' was a good predictor for specialists of mobile animal taxa. Plant specialists showed a pronounced dependence on quality measures at the patch scale and at the landscape scale, whereas animal specialists were influenced by patch size, patch quality, landscape quality and isolation measures. None of the taxa benefited from linear structures in the surroundings. In conclusion, high patch quality and a network of high-quality areas in the surrounding landscape should be the best conservation strategy to ensure conservation of dry grassland specialists. This goal does not conflict with the specific demands of single taxa. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The backbone of its distribution in eastern Czechia, however, is a system of pollard willows in intensively farmed lowlands. Pollarding, a traditional agroforestry practice inducing formation of tree hollows, was partly abandoned in the area during the twentieth century. Aim To assess the state of the system of pollard willows and to investigate parameters of pollards and their stands which affect the beetle's presence. Methods We inventoried pollard trees and beetle distribution across ca 2000 km(2) of lowlands along the Dyje, Morava and Odra rivers and their tributaries in eastern Czechia and westernmost Slovakia. Results We found 10 441 pollard willows in 324 stands: most stands contained trees of large diameters and poor health; young trees were rare. Probability of O. barnabita presence increased with number of trees in stand, decreased with distance to the nearest occupied stand, and was further affected by the health state of trees. Discussion Our results show that high hollow density in pollards allows for the existence of specialized, dispersal limited forest organisms in virtually deforested landscapes. They suggest stands should contain at least 200-300 pollard willows to sustain the beetle population. Although the beetle is still widespread over the study area, the existing populations are isolated and subjected to extinction debt.

"JOUR",NA,"Blanchard, Gregoire and Birnbaum, Philippe and Munoz, Francois","Extinction-immigration dynamics lag behind environmental filtering in shaping the composition of tropical dry forests within a changing landscape","The impact of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity is a major issue. However, we still lack an integrative understanding of how these changes influence biodiversity dynamics over time. In this study, we investigate the effects of these changes in terms of both niche-based and neutral dynamics. We hypothesize that habitat loss has delayed effects on neutral immigration-extinction dynamics, while edge effects and environmental heterogeneity in habitat patches have rapid effects on niche-based dynamics. We analyzed taxonomic and functional composition of 100 tree communities in a tropical dry forest landscape of New-Caledonia subject to habitat loss and fragmentation. We designed an original, process-based simulation framework, and performed Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer the influence of niche-based and neutral processes. Then, we performed partial regressions to evaluate the relationships between inferred parameter values of communities and landscape metrics (distance to edge, patch area, and habitat amount around communities), derived from either recent or past (65 yrs ago) aerial photographs, while controlling for the effect of soil and topography. We found that landscape structure influences both environmental filtering and immigration. Immigration rate was positively related to past habitat amount surrounding communities. In contrast, environmental filtering was mostly affected by present landscape structure and mainly influenced by edge vicinity and topography. Our results highlight that landscape changes have contrasting spatio-temporal influences on niche-based and neutral assembly dynamics. First, landscape-level habitat loss and community isolation reduce immigration and increase demographic stochasticity, resulting in slow decline of local species diversity and extinction debt. Second, recent edge creation affects environmental filtering, incurring rapid changes in community composition by favoring species with edge-adapted strategies. Our study brings new insights about temporal impacts of landscape changes on biodiversity dynamics. We stress that landscape history critically influences these dynamics and should be taken into account in conservation policies. New Caledonia is an archipelago located in southwest Pacific (20-23Â° S, 164-167Â° E). The study area is a 20x20km landscape located in a plain surrounded by low-elevation mountains (500-1000m), on the west coast of the main island (Kone-Pouembout plain). It receives ~1000-1400 mmÂ·yr-1 rainfall and the mean annual temperature is ~23-24 Â°C (WorldClim2 database, Fick & Hijmans 2017). The vegetation is a mosaic of evergreen dry forest patches (tropical dry forest, Holdridge 1947) surrounded by secondary thickets and farmlands. We designed a random sampling scheme stratified by patch area. Based on a present landscape map, we selected 36 accessible patches spanning a wide range of area (0.5-272.2 ha, median 23.6). We excluded areas recently colonized by the forest (i.e., areas currently covered by forest, but which were open in 1954). Then, we applied a 25*25m square grid and, in each patch, we randomly selected a number of grid nodes proportionally to the logarithm of patch area.Within a circular 400m plot (i.e., 11.30m radius) at each selected point, we identified all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 meters above ground) above 10cm. We ensured that the entire plots were actually within forest patches by relocating the center of plots away from the edge if necessary. All the plots were established during years 2017 and 2018. For all sampled species, we measured five wood and leaf functional traits involved in resource-use strategies and stress resistance, following standardized protocols in Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). Trait were collected during years 2017 and 2018. For leaf traits, we collected five leaves per individual and sampled five individuals per species. For compound leaves, we considered a leaflet as the laminar unit. Petioles and petiolules were removed from leaves before measurement. We measured leaf area (the area of a leaf in cm), Specific Leaf Area (the leaf area per dry mass in cmÂ·g- 1), and Leaf Dry-Matter Content (the leaf dry mass per fresh mass in mgÂ·g- 1). Specific leaf area and leaf dry-matter content capture species investment in leaves, and represent a trade-off between acquisitive (high specific leaf area) and conservative (high leaf dry-matter content) strategies along the leaf economic spectrum (Wright et al. 2004). Leaf area represents the light-capturing and transpiration surface and is thus related to water-use efficiency (Moles 2018). We measured the wood density of one wood sample per individual and five individuals per species. Wood density is a key trait of the wood economic spectrum, from water use efficiency and high growth rate to lower growth rate and drought resistance (Chave et al. 2009). Furthermore, we measured bark thickness. Thick bark provides stem protection from heat and fire (Pausas 2015), as well as from other damages (Rosell 2016). For bark thickness, we calculated the mean of two bark measures on individual trees, and sampled at least 15 individuals per species (mean = 17.8). For wood density and bark thickness of 38 species, data were complemented from the New Caledonian plant inventory and permanent plot network (NC-PIPPN) database, in which trait measurements were carried out using identical protocols (Ibanez et al. 2017a). In subsequent analyses, we used the mean trait value per species for leaf traits and wood density. As bark thickness varies with DBH (Pausas 2015), we used the maximum value per species, to better approximate an upper bound reached during tree growth. We used a Box-Cox transformation (Box & Cox 1964) on each trait to get distributions closer to normality. The five functional traits were finally informed for 99 species, representing 90% of the identified species (n = 110), and more than 99% of the identified individuals (n = 3069). We used this subset of 99 species in further analyses. We evaluated trait covariation to identify main functional dimensions (trait spectra) across species by performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of species traits values, with varimax orthogonal rotation of the three first components. Trait values were centered and scaled to unit variance before performing PCA. We considered species scores on the first three rotated PCA (RPCA) axes as synthetic trait values representing species ecological strategies along the main functional dimensions. The synthetic trait values where standardized between 0 and 1. Wequantified summary statistics representing (i) taxonomic composition, i.e., species richness (S, the number of species) and Shannon diversity (ES), and (ii) functional composition, i.e., community weighted mean (CWM) and community weighted variance (CWV) of eachtrait and each synthetic trait (RPCA axes).

We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and supergeneralists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change.",NA,NA,"2012","ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC","2012","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 46: GLOBAL CHANGE IN MULTISPECIES SYSTEMS, PT 1","46",NA,"89","210","10.1016/B978-0-12-396992-7.00002-2","0065-2504 and 2163-582X and 978-0-12-396992-7","WOS:000319706500002","525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","Review and Book Chapter","SAN DIEGO",NA,NA,"Jacob, U and Woodward, G",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hagen, Melanie et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Lopez, JE","Parasite prevalence and the size of host populations: An experimental test","Although important in epidemiological theory, the relationship between the size of host populations and the prevalence of parasites has not been investigated empirically. Commonly used models suggest no relationship, but this prediction is sensitive to assumptions about parasite transmission. In laboratory populations, I manipulated the size of Tribolium castaneum flour beetle populations and measured the prevalence and distribution of a parasitic mite, Acorophenax tribolii. I found that parasite prevalence did not vary for a wide range of host population sizes. However, prevalence was lower in populations with less than 40 hosts. This effect cannot be attributed to changes in host population density because host density was held constant among treatments. The reduction in prevalence of small populations below a threshold that I observed is predicted by the extinction debt model, but it is not expected from models of host-parasite interactions that assume density-dependent transmission. The distribution of parasites, measured Using Lloyd's patchiness index, was not affected by host population size. The mean crowding of parasites, however, was negatively related with host density. Finally, the prevalence of parasites in large populations did not differ from that found in sets of smaller patches as long as the smaller populations in aggregate were equivalent in size to the large population.",NA,NA,"2005","ALLEN PRESS INC","2005 FEB","JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY","91","1","32","37","10.1645/GE-323R","0022-3395 and 1937-2345","WOS:000227733100006","810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","Article","LAWRENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lopez, JE (2005) Parasite Prevalence and the Size of Host Populations: An Experimental Test. <i>Jour</i>.

This can lead to a gross underestimation of species declines in response to habitat loss, especially when species declines are gradual and occur over long time periods. Using Cold War spy satellite images (Corona), we show that a grassland keystone species, the bobak marmot (Marmota bobak), continues to respond to agricultural expansion that happened more than 50 years ago. Although burrow densities of the bobak marmot today are highest in croplands, densities declined most strongly in areas that were persistently used as croplands since the 1960s. This response to historical agricultural conversion spans roughly eight marmot generations and suggests the longest recorded response of a mammal species to agricultural expansion. We also found evidence for remarkable philopatry: nearly half of all burrows retained their exact location since the 1960s, and this was most pronounced in grasslands. Our results stress the need for farsighted decisions, because contemporary land management will affect biodiversity decades into the future.

We report on temporal changes in the occurrence of birds over 21 years within continuous forest in the Warrumbungle Mountains to evaluate the influence of rainfall variability on changes in the abundance of birds and species occurence. During this period, six common insectivores declined significantly (Superb Fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus; White-throated Gerygone, Gerygone albogularis; Grey Shrike-thrush, Colluricincla harmonica; Rufous Whistler, Pachycephala rufiventris; Grey Fantail, Rhipidura albiscapa; Eastern Yellow Robin, Eopsaltria australis). Rainfall significantly predicted the abundance of 13 of the 25 most common species, with the rainfall period of both July-December of the previous year and the combined effects of six years of January-June rainfall correlated with changes in the abundance of birds. Prolonged drought has likely driven food shortages (especially of litter-dwelling arthropods), with changes in avian community composition reflecting changes in food availability. Thus, avian declines in southern Australia may reflect the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and other landscape-scale changes in concert with larger-scale ecological processes driven by decreased rainfall. Improved linkages between forested and agricultural landscapes at the regional scale are needed to buffer against local fluctuations in resources.",NA,NA,"2013","CSIRO PUBLISHING","2013","EMU","113","2","112","121","10.1071/MU12063","0158-4197","WOS:000319470100004","150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA","Article","COLLINGWOOD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Stevens, Helen C. et al.

However, empirical determination of these thresholds in real landscapes (e.g., by using molecular-genetic methods) is very difficult due to long time lags in population reactions (""extinction debt""), and due to many confounding ecological variables.

Ecological restoration offers a promising way to enhance biodiversity persistence and the delivery of ecosystem services by: 1) establishing structural elements in the landscape to enhance connectivity, 2) providing additional forest cover, 3) restoring degraded forest remnants through protection from human-mediated disturbances and reestablishment of successional trajectory, and 4) supporting sustainable socio-economic development in marginalized rural communities, where the lack of job opportunities drives deforestation, forest degradation, and overexploitation. Due to biodiversity requirements, however, this potential will only be realized if restoration is carried out on very large spatial scales. Although conservation biologists have historically doubted the potential of ecological restoration to reverse ecosystem degradation and mitigate species loss, we argue that conservation policies and programs should include restoration among the strategies adopted to mitigate extinction debts and support the creation of biodiversity friendly-landscapes.

The principal human-induced disturbance regimes affecting this forest include logging and livestock grazing. Vegetation data were collected in 65 plots (50 m x 50 m); seedling species composition and density were determined in 10 m x 10 m nested plots. We used a cluster analysis to identify plant communities and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to investigate environmental factors that influenced the distribution of the emergent plant communities. Three plant communities were identified: a Juniperus procera-Maytenus senegalensis community, which represented a phase of the potential natural dry Afromontane forest vegetation on steep slopes with shallow soils, a Pterolobium stellatum-Celtis africana community, found on more mesic sites, and a Cadia purpurea-Opuntia ficus-indica community, typically representing severely disturbed habitats. Altitude, slope, soil depth and distance to the nearest stream, which we collectively interpreted as a moisture gradient, and forest disturbance separated the plant communities. With only 39 of the 79 recorded woody species present in the seedling layer, the forest currently faces an extinction debt of 50 per cent of the total woody species pool. Human disturbance has clearly affected plant species diversity in this forest as degraded plant communities typically lacked the commercially interesting or otherwise valuable tree species, were encroached by shrubs and in areas severely invaded by alien species. Further disturbance will most likely result in additional declines in biodiversity through local extinction of indigenous tree species. Despite the problems associated with conserving plant species diversity in small and isolated populations, this relic forest is of particular importance for regional conservation of forest biodiversity, as species with high conservation value, such as Afrocarpus falcatus, Allophylus abyssinicus and Bersama abyssinica, are still present as mature trees, and as other forest fragments in the region are two orders of magnitude smaller, and therefore more heavily impacted by small population sizes and unfavourable edge effects.

However, susceptibility to fragmentation varies between species and may be influenced by for instance specialization, functional traits and trophic level. We examined how total and specialist species richness, species composition and functional trait composition at two trophic levels (vascular plants and sap-feeding hoppers) vary with habitat fragmentation (patch size and connectivity) in dry calcareous grasslands in southeast Norway. We found that fragmentation affected plant and hopper species composition both totally and of habitat specialists, but with a net species loss only for the specialists, indicating greater susceptibility of specialized species. Reductions in patch size and increasing isolation negatively affected plant specialists with different sets of traits, effectively reducing the number of species with trait combinations suitable to persist in small and isolated patches. Fragmentation influenced trait composition of the total hopper community, but not of habitat specialists. A lesser degree of habitat association could explain why hoppers, despite belonging to a higher tropic level, seemed to be less susceptible to fragmentation than plants. Nonetheless, our study shows that habitat fragmentation affects both species richness, species composition and trait composition of plants and hoppers, indicating that fragmentation leads not only to a loss of species, but also alters dominance hierarchies and the functionality of grassland communities.",NA,NA,"2018","SPRINGER","2018 JUL","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","27","9","2329","2361","10.1007/s10531-018-1540-z","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000434373100012","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Olsen, Siri Lie et al.

Vegetational belts and mammalian communities underwent major reorganisation. New radiocarbon data show that the complex series of climatic changes affected the ranges of mammalian species dramatically, but in differing ways related to the ecologies of individual species. For species that ultimately went extinct, the reduction in range was a prolonged and geographically complex process taking thousands or tens of thousands of years. Recent genetic studies using ancient DNA show that this process was often accompanied by loss of genetic variation and, presumably, adaptive flexibility. Even so, some species survived for thousands of years in small, terminal refugia before finally becoming extinct - a pattern akin to the 'extinction lag' or 'extinction debt' posited for endangered modern taxa. Whether refugial. species can survive to re-expand into new areas, especially in anthropogenically disturbed environments, is determined by a complex of factors and is not inevitable.

In the second experiment, we study the immediate surroundings of small forest brooks, which are defined as valuable habitats in the Finnish Forest Act. Our aim is to determine the effect of silvicultural practices conducted at the valuable habitats or in the vicinity of them on long term persistence of the special characteristics of these habitats.

To test this assumption, we conducted a meta-analysis with data on 97 woody plant species derived from 98 studies of habitat fragmentation. We measured the weighted response of four different measures of population-level genetic diversity to habitat fragmentation with Hedge's d and Spearman rank correlation. We tested whether the genetic response to habitat fragmentation was mediated by life-history traits (longevity, pollination mode, and seed dispersal vector) and study characteristics (genetic marker and plant material used). For both tests of effect size habitat fragmentation was associated with a substantial decrease in expected heterozygosity, number of alleles, and percentage of polymorphic loci, whereas the population inbreeding coefficient was not associated with these measures. The largest proportion of variation among effect sizes was explained by pollination mechanism and by the age of the tissue (progeny or adult) that was genotyped. Our primary finding was that wind-pollinated trees and shrubs appeared to be as likely to lose genetic variation as insect-pollinated species, indicating that severe habitat fragmentation may lead to pollen limitation and limited gene flow. In comparison with results of previous meta-analyses on mainly herbaceous species, we found trees and shrubs were as likely to have negative genetic responses to habitat fragmentation as herbaceous species. We also found that the genetic variation in offspring was generally less than that of adult trees, which is evidence of a genetic extinction debt and probably reflects the genetic diversity of the historical, less-fragmented landscape.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 APR","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","26","2","228","237","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01778.x","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000301981100006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Vranckx, Guy et al.

Environmental conditions at 38 C. umbellata sites in the provinces of Uppland and Sodermanland, Sweden, included light inflow, cover of competitive species, soil nitrogen, continuity of forest cover and soil texture. The results suggested that population size was negatively affected by cover of competitive species. Population size was not related to light availability although increased shading was associated with decreased flowering frequency. Fruit set was negatively affected by cover of competitive species, and seed production decreased with increasing soil nitrogen content. Fruit set and seed production increased with increasing population size. This study shows that denser forest stands and increased abundance of Vaccinium myrtillus and graminoid species may have strong negative effects on C. umbellata. This species' longevity and clonal propagation may buffer some negative impacts, which in turn might contribute to an extinction debt.

"JOUR",NA,"Mennicken, Sophie and Kondratow, Floriane and Buralli, Florian and Manzi, Sophie and Andrieu, Emilie and Roy, Melanie and Brin, Antoine","Effects of Past and Present-Day Landscape Structure on Forest Soil Microorganisms","Principles of landscape ecology have been built on birds and plant species distribution, but the number of clues is now growing on below-ground organisms, whose dispersal may also be affected by above-ground landscape structure. For communities of microorganisms, the question remains if and how they answer to landscape structure, with or without time lag, and if some groups of microorganisms may react more than others. Here, we investigated if fungi or bacteria diversity is driven by the amount of forest cover in the current or the past landscape. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis (HAH) on ancient forests of Cevennes national park, that were particularly fragmented 150 years ago, and are today surrounded by recent forests. As ancient forests are often more diverse in plant species, we hypothesized that the higher quantity of ancient forests in the landscape, the richer fungal and bacterial communities would be locally. More precisely, we expected that ectomycorrhizal fungi, and pathotrophic fungi, often indicators of mature forests, would be also more sensitive to forest history and therefore to the quantity of ancient forests than bacteria and saprotrophic fungi. We sampled 40 soil cores per 0.5 ha, pooled in 8 composite samples per plot in 27 landscapes and sequenced ITS and 16S marker by Illumina-Mi seq. To identify functional groups of fungi, we relied on their taxonomy and the use of public databases. Our results partly follow the HAH, as fungi richness was positively related with the quantity of ancient forests in the landscape and not by the focal patch size. Ectomycorrhizal and pathotrophic fungi were positively affected by the ancient forest cover, and so were saprotrophic ones, but not bacteria. Local factors also shaped the communities such as soil composition and elevation, confirming classical patterns in soil ecology. Interestingly, past landscape structure better explained fungi communities richness than contemporary landscape, suggesting a time lag in the response of communities to landscape modification and a potential extinction debt. Our results invite to consider below-ground communities in landscape studies and historical ecology, as their structure and functions might be intimately linked with soil and landscape history. Soil samples were collected on April 2017 (average temperature 4.4 Â°C, average precipitation 17.6 mm from www infoclimat.fr). In each study site, soil cores were collected along two 60 m transect, spaced from 20 m : every 20 m a soil core was collected, and pooled with four soil cores collected at 3.5 m from the focal point in each cardinal direction. As a result, 40 soil cores pooled in 8 composite samples were collected per plot. The composite samples were then opened back to the lab the same day, and 15 g of soil was isolated in a clean tea-bag and dried with 50 g of silicagel (eventually more if the sample was not dry the day after). Soil DNA was extracted less than one month later with Macherey NagelNucleoSpin Soilkit (Ref740780.250). Amplifications targeted ITS1 nuclear rDNA primers for fungi (Fwd: ITS5 GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG from Epp et al. 2012 and a modified version of Rev: 5.8S_Fungi CAAGAGATCCGTTGTTGAAAGTK, Taberlet et al. 2018), and 16S rDNA (V5-V6) for bacteria (Bact01 primers - Fwd: GGATTAGATACCCTGGTAGT and Rev: CACGACACGAGCTGACG (Fliegerova et al. 2014)). Each PCR was performed with a unique set of primers, characterized by a unique set of 8 nucleotide tags added to the universal primers, allowing to distinguish samples later in the analysis (as described in Taberlet et al. 2018). Negative controls without any PCR reactants were integrated (10% of our reactions) and all PCR reactions were replicated twice. PCR conditions followed Nagati et al. (2018).

A secondary gharial population resides in riverine-reservoir habitat adjacent to the Nepal border, within the Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), and nests along a 10 km riverbank of the Girwa River. A natural channel shift in the mainstream Karnali River (upstream in Nepal) has reduced seasonal flow in the Girwa stretch where gharials nest, coincident with a gradual loss of nest sites, which in turn was related to an overall shift to woody vegetation at these sites. To understand how these changes in riparian vegetation on riverbanks were related to gharial nesting, we sampled vegetation at these sites from 2017 to 2019, and derived an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from LANDSAT 8 satellite data to quantify riverside vegetation from 1988 through 2019. We found that sampled sites transitioned to woody cover, the number of nesting sites declined, and the number of nests were reduced by>40%. At these sites, after the channel shift, woody vegetation replaced open sites that predominated prior to the channel shift. Our findings indicate that the lack of open riverbanks and the increase in woody vegetation at potential nesting sites threatens the reproductive success of the KWS gharial population. This population persists today in a regulated river ecosystem, and nests in an altered riparian habitat which appears to be increasingly unsuitable for the continued successful recruitment of breeding adults.

There has been little empirical evidence, however, to guide the evaluation or application of metapopulation concepts. From knowledge of salmonid life histories and our own work with bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi) and westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi), we suggest that simple generalizations of salmonid metapopulations are inappropriate. Although spatial structuring and dispersal mechanisms are evident, the relevance of extinction and colonization processes are likely to vary with life history, species, scale, and landscape. Understanding dispersal, the role of suitable but unoccupied habitats, and the potential for extinction debts in non-equilibrium metapopulations are key issues. With regard to conservation of salmonids, we suggest that efforts to understand and conserve key processes likely to influence the persistence of populations or metapopulations will be more successful than efforts to design minimal habitat reserves based on metapopulation theory.",NA,NA,"2000","WILEY","2000 JUN","ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH","9","1-2","51","64","10.1034/j.1600-0633.2000.90106.x","0906-6691 and 1600-0633","WOS:000087138500006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article and Proceedings Paper","HOBOKEN",NA,"Ecology of Stream Fish Symposium",NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rieman, BE et al.

In Russia, vast areas of forest-steppe grasslands have been converted to cropland during Soviet times, whilst remaining grasslands were often intensively grazed. Contrastingly, the collapse of the Soviet Union have resulted in a massive reduction in livestock numbers and cessation of management. Albeit relatively large natural grassland areas remained in the Western Siberian Plain, their present condition is poorly studied. We analysed plant species composition, functional structure and richness of grassland communities and tested for the effect of local factors (management, abiotic site conditions) and landscape factors (patch size, proportion of land cover types) on diversity patterns. Abiotic site conditions, mainly soil moisture and salinity, differentiated distinct community types. Overall, species richness was highest in meadow steppe communities with lower soil moisture and salinity. Grazing intensity and litter accumulation due to cessation of management were significant negative related to species richness and shaped the functional structure. At the landscape scale, diversity in meadow steppe grasslands was higher in forest-grassland mosaics and in small remnants isolated in a matrix of cropland. Our findings highlight that meadow steppes suffered massively under the historical habitat loss and high grazing pressure. Small species-rich remnants are evidence of the former extent of meadow steppe habitats in agricultural landscape, but are likely threatened by an extinction debt.

The current global trend towards human population growth and widespread environmental degradation means that such areas are becoming increasingly isolated, fragmented habitat islands. In regions in which this process is well advanced, a high proportion of species are thus predicted to have become restricted to protected areas. Here, using uniquely detailed datasets for Britain, a region with close to the global level of percentage coverage by statutory protected areas, we determine the extent of restriction of species of conservation concern to these areas. On the basis of currently known distributions, more than a half of such species are highly dependent on protected areas for their continued persistence, occurring either entirely or largely within their bounds. Such coverage is of particular importance for those species with narrower distributions, and therefore, under the greatest threats, underlining the vital importance of adequately resourcing, maintaining, and developing protected areas to prevent these species from being lost.",NA,NA,"2008","WILEY","2008 SEP","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","14","9","2132","2138","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01628.x","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000258257700013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jackson, Sarah F. et al.

Building on theory that predicts multi-species coexistence based on a competition-colonisation tradeoff, we derive a mechanistic basis by which human-mediated species invasions could cause extinctions through competitive displacement. In contrast to past invasions, humans principally introduce modern invaders, repeatedly and in large quantities, and in ways that can facilitate release from enemies and competitors. Associated increases in exotic species' propagule rain, survival and competitive ability could enable some introduced species to overcome the tradeoffs that constrain all other species. Using evidence from metacommunity models, we show how species introductions could disrupt species coexistence, generating extinction debts, especially when combined with other forms of anthropogenic environmental change. Even though competing species have typically coexisted following past biogeographic migrations, the multiplicity and interactive impacts of today's threats could change some exotic species into agents of extinction.",NA,NA,"2018","NATURE PORTFOLIO","2018 MAY 30","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS","9",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41467-018-04491-3","2041-1723","WOS:000433541300002","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Article","BERLIN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Catford, Jane A. et al.

Here, we conduct the first range-wide assessment of Sumatran tiger genetics using scat surveys and show that the wild population retains levels of genetic heterozygosity comparable to mainland tigers. However, the population also exhibits signs of subdivision due to the unprecedented rates of deforestation and land conversion in the last 30-40 years. The fact that this subspecies retains such levels of heterozygosity despite high rates of habitat loss and increasing isolation suggests a form of genetic extinction debt with an elevated risk of extinction if no action is taken within the next 30-100 years (see Kenney et al., 2014). However, the inherent time delay in extinction debt provides opportunities for conservation if habitat quality can be improved and connections between existing population fragments can be made. Our study highlights the importance of genetic studies for providing baseline information to improve the population management of highly threatened carnivore species.

Church forests deliver ecosystem services such as forest products and erosion control, and are considered a benchmark for assessing forest biodiversity quality. However, safeguarding church forest integrity necessitates a better understanding of the factors determining their biodiversity and community structure. Therefore, we surveyed a network of church forests southeast of Lake Tana to assess factors explaining their tree species richness and composition. We found that the 24 church forests studied here represent about 20% of the ca. 270 tree species that occur in tropical northeast Africa. All surveyed forests however face strong extinction debts, with five tree species at risk of completely disappearing from the region and many more species only regenerating in a limited number of church forests. Church forest integrity partially reflected the anthropogenic pressure on the area, as forest regeneration tended to be stronger in fenced church forests. Seedling abundance depended on the local presence of large, mature conspecific trees and on the geographic distance to potential source populations of seeds, strongly suggest that metapopulation dynamics likely are important. We conclude that church forest conservation and minimizing further degradation of the landscape matrix are needed to help sustaining the ecological and socioeconomic potential of this unique network of remnant forests.

Recent worldwide mammal declines have highlighted the conservation importance of effective assessments of trends in distribution and abundance of species. Yet reliable data depicting the nature and extent of changes in population parameters is sparse, primarily due to logistical problems in covering large areas and difficulties in obtaining reliable information at large spatial scales, particularly over time. We used key informant surveys to generate detection histories for 18 species of large mammals (body mass > 2 kg) at two points in time (present and 30 years ago) in the Southern sub-region of the Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot. Multiple-season occupancy models were used to assess temporal trends in occupancy, detectability and vital rates of extinction and colonization for each species. Our results show significant declines in distribution for large carnivores, the Asian elephant and endemic ungulates and primates. There is a significant decline in detectability for 16 species, which suggests a decline in their abundance. These patterns of change in distribution and abundance repeat in our assessments of spatial variation in occupancy dynamics between the three contiguous forest complexes and two human-dominated landscapes into which the southern Western Ghats has been fragmented. Extinction rates are highest in the human-dominated landscapes. Declines in abundance for several species suggest the presence of extinction debts, which may soon be repaid with imminent range contractions and subsequent species extinctions unless immediate remedial conservation measures are taken. Detection/non-detection surveys of key informants used in an occupancy modeling framework provide potential for rapid conservation status assessments of multiple species across large spatial scales over time.

Grasslands in the NGP are no longer self-regulating adaptive systems. The challenges to these grasslands are widespread and serious (e.g. climate change, invasive species, fragmentation, altered disturbance regimes, and anthropogenic chemical loads). Because the challenges facing the region are dynamic, complex, and persistent, a paradigm shift in how we approach restoration and management of the grasslands in the NGP is imperative. The goal of this article is to highlight four key points for land managers and restoration practitioners to consider when planning management or restoration actions. First, we discuss the appropriateness of using historical fidelity as a restoration or management target because of changing climate, widespread pervasiveness of invasive species, the high level of fragmentation, and altered disturbance regimes. Second, we highlight ecosystem resilience and long-term population persistence as alternative targets. Third, because the NGP is so heavily impacted with anthropogenic chemical loading, we discuss the risks of ecological traps and extinction debt. Finally, we highlight the importance of using adaptive management and having patience during restoration and management. Consideration of these four points will help management and restoration of grasslands move toward a more successful and sustainable future.

We studied colonization for a guild of epiphytic lichens in a former treeless heathland area of 170 km 2 in southwest Norway. We investigated if epiphytic lichen species richness and composition on aspen (Populus tremula) trees corresponded to a random draw of lichen individuals from the regional species pool. We compared lichen communities of isolated young (55-120 yr) and old (140-200 yr) forest patches in the heathland area to those of aspen forest in an adjacent reference area that has been forested for a long time. All thalli (lichen bodies) of 32 selected lichen species on trunks of aspen were recorded in 35 aspen sites. When data for each site category (young, old, and reference) were pooled, we found the species richness by rarefaction to be similar for reference sites and old sites, but significantly lower for young sites. The depauperated species richness of young sites was accompanied by a skew in species composition and absence of several species that were common in the reference sites. In contrast, genetic variation screened with neutral microsatellite markers in the lichen species Lobaria pulmonaria showed no significant differences between site categories. Our null hypothesis of a neutral species assembly in young sites corresponding to a random draw from the regional species pool was rejected, whereas an alternative hypothesis based on differences in colonization capacity among species was supported. The results indicate that for the habitat configuration in the heathland area (isolated patches constituting <0.4% of the area) lichen communities may need a colonization time of 100-150 yr for species richness to level off, but given enough time, isolation will not affect species richness.

Here, we extend the classic Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) to account for nonrandom processes by incorporating species traits and phylogenetic relationships into a study of faunal relaxation following habitat loss and fragmentation. Two possible mechanisms can create nonrandom community patterns on fragment islands. First, small and isolated islands might consist of similar or closely related species because they are environmentally homogeneous or select for certain shared traits, such as dispersal ability. Alternatively, communities on small islands might contain more dissimilar or distantly related species than on large islands because limited space and resource availability result in greater competitive exclusion among species with high niche overlap. Breeding birds were surveyed on 36 islands and two mainland sites annually from 2010 to 2014 in the Thousand Island Lake region, China. We assessed community structure of breeding birds on these subtropical land-bridge islands by integrating species' trait and evolutionary distances. We additionally analysed habitat heterogeneity and variance in size ratios to distinguish biotic and abiotic processes of community assembly. Results showed that functional-phylogenetic diversity increased with island area, and decreased with isolation. Bird communities on the mainland were more diverse and generally less clustered than island bird communities and not different than randomly assembled communities. Bird communities on islands tend to be functionally similar and phylogenetically clustered, especially on small and isolated islands. The nonrandom decline in species diversity and change in bird community structure with island area and isolation, along with the relatively homogeneous habitats on small islands, support the environmental filtering hypothesis. Our study demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple forms of diversity for understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, and further reveals that TIB could be extended to community measures by moving beyond assumptions of species equivalency in colonisation rates and extinction susceptibilities.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 MAY","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","86","3","532","542","10.1111/1365-2656.12650","0021-8790 and 1365-2656","WOS:000398826400013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Si, Xingfeng et al.

However, studies have frequently reported negative or nonsignificant relationships. In a vast majority of them, environmental heterogeneity was defined along a gradient of increasing randomness, toward complete disorder. A new conceptual framework could help to reconcile the array of observed relationships. Using an extensive literature review, we test a conceptual framework proposing that the direction of environmental-heterogeneity biodiversity relationships is contingent on the level of human footprint to which an ecosystem is subjected (the anthropocline). The results reveal that highly modified and seminatural ecosystems are characterized by a dominance of positive and negative EH BD relationships, respectively, whereas natural ecosystems show mixed responses. Out of this novel framework arises the revised perspective that natural ecosystems are typified, not by maximal or minimal, but by intermediate levels of environmental heterogeneity.",NA,NA,"2014","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2014 AUG","ECOLOGY","95","8","2084","2095","10.1890/13-1344.1","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000340215900008","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Seiferling, Ian et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Spalding, Christopher and Hull, Pincelli","Biodiversity data from: The mass extinction debt of the Anthropocene","To make sense of our present biodiversity crises, the modern rate of species extinctions is commonly compared to a benchmark, or ""background,"" rate derived from the fossil record. These estimates are critical for bounding the scale of modern diversity loss, but have yet to account for the fundamental structure of extinction rates through time. Namely, a substantial fraction of extinctions within the fossil record occur within relatively short-lived extinction pulses, and not during intervals characterized by background rates of extinction. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to compare the modern event to these pulses than to the long-term average rate. Unfortunately, neither the duration of extinction pulses in the geological record nor the ultimate magnitude of the extinction pulse today is resolved, making assessments of their relative sizes difficult. In addition, the common metric used to compare current and past extinction rates does not correct for large differences in observation duration. Here we propose a new predictive metric that may be used to ascertain the ultimate extent of the ongoing extinction threat, building on the observation that extinction magnitude in the marine fossil record is correlated to the magnitude of sedimentary turnover. Thus, we propose that the ultimate number of species destined for extinction today can be predicted by way of a quantitative appraisal of humanity's modification of ecosystems as recorded in sediments -that is, by comparing our future rock record with that of the past. The ubiquity of habitat disruption worldwide suggests that a profound mass extinction debt exists today, but one that might yet be averted by preserving and restoring ecosystems and their geological traces.

Here, it is argued that warming-induced species losses will generally exceed gains and there will be more net declines than net increases in plant community richness. Declines in richness are especially likely in water-limited climates where intensifying aridity will increasingly exceed plant tolerances, but also in colder temperature-limited climates where steep climatic gradients are lacking, and therefore, large pools of appropriate species are not immediately adjacent. The selectivity of warming-induced losses may lead to declines in functional and phylogenetic diversity as well as in species richness, especially in water-limited climates. Our current understanding of climate-caused diversity trends may be overly influenced by numerous studies coming from north-temperate alpine mountaintops, where conditions are unusually favourable for increases-possibly temporary-in local species richness.

Yet its applicability has been severely criticized, mainly because the original model assumed a strict competitive hierarchy of species and did not allow for any preemptive effect. We considered the impact of relaxing both of these limitations on coexistence. Relaxing trade-off intensity makes coexistence less likely and introduces a minimum colonization rate below which any coexistence is impossible. Allowing for preemption introduces a limit to dissimilarity between species. Surprisingly, preemption does not impede coexistence as one could presume from previous studies, but can actually increase the likelihood of coexistence. Its effect on coexistence depends on whether or not species in the regional pool are strongly limited in their colonization ability. Preemption is predicted to favour coexistence when: (i) species are not strongly limited in their colonization ability; and (ii) the competitive trade-off is not infinitely intense.",NA,NA,"2006","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","2006 AUG","ECOLOGY LETTERS","9","8","897","907","10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00930.x","1461-023X","WOS:000239510700001","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Calcagno, V. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Hunter, JT","Geographic variation in plant species richness patterns within temperate eucalypt woodlands of eastern Australia","Species density, pattern diversity and species pool are often studied in isolation and correlated individually to environmental gradients. However analysis of how these three measures interrelate can give insights into the interpretation of local and regional processes. In addition, an understanding of how these diversity measures change across the natural distribution of a community may help in decision making processes regarding reservation. Temperate eucalypt woodlands in eastern Australia are one of the most visible and ubiquitous communities in eastern Australia, but have undergone one of the most significant modification and fragmentation processes due to past and current pressure to clear for agriculture. Data from 176 vascular plant survey sites sampled across 14 woodland assemblages are used here to analyse geographic gradients in species density, pattern diversity and species pool size. It was discovered that species density was significantly correlated to pattern diversity and species pool size but that pattern diversity and species pool size were uncorrelated. There was a significant relationship whereby species density increased as pattern diversity decreased. These patterns may be explained by the maintenance of interconnectedness, dispersal and rescue effects at this scale of investigation but local interactions cannot be ruled out as important. Generally species density and species pool size increased from west to east in the study area and pattern diversity was strongly correlated to the coldest minimum winter temperatures. It is suggested that if local woodland richness is maintained by low pattern diversity and greater habitat connectedness then larger reserves are required in order to maintain the largest area of contiguous habitat. In such situations small isolated patches, which are increasingly fragmented by the pressure to clear for agriculture will accumulate larger extinction debts.",NA,NA,"2005","WILEY","2005 AUG","ECOGRAPHY","28","4","505","514",NA,"0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000230343000009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hunter, JT (2005) Geographic Variation in Plant Species Richness Patterns Within Temperate Eucalypt Woodlands of Eastern Australia. <i>Jour</i>.

In this study, we examine the effects of grassland fragmentation and land use in the landscape matrix (on a 2 km scale) on species richness of plants, butterflies, bees and hoverflies. These organisms were studied in replicated remnant patches of different sizes and isolation, embedded in landscapes dominated either by forest, arable land or a mix of these.We found positive effects of patch area on species richness of the three insect taxa, but not of plants. Isolation had a negative effect only on hoverflies. Matrix type had contrasting effects on the studied taxa. Species richness of plants and butterflies was lowest in patches in landscapes dominated by arable land and highest in forest-dominated landscapes. For hoverflies, the negative effect of small patch area was strongest in forest-dominated landscapes, and there was a similar non-significant trend for bees. Our study shows the importance of considering matrix characteristics when studying responses to habitat fragmentation. Differences in matrix response among organism groups probably impinge on differing mechanisms. A forest matrix is likely to provide additional resources for butterflies but either constitute a barrier to dispersal or deprive resources as compared to an arable matrix for hoverflies. Enhanced plant diversity in grassland patches embedded in forested landscapes can be explained by habitat generalists more easily invading these patches, or by an unpaid extinction debt in these landscapes.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 MAR","ECOGRAPHY","35","3","259","267","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06870.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000300979800008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ockinger, Erik et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Lindborg, R and Eriksson, O","Historical landscape connectivity affects present plant species diversity","Transformation of landscapes is considered to be one of the main drivers behind species loss, regionally and globally. Theory and empirical studies suggest that landscape structure influences species diversity in many habitats. These effects may be manifested at different spatial scales depending on species response to landscape heterogeneity. A similar, but often neglected, scaling issue concerns the temporal scale of species response to landscape change. In this study, we found time lags of 50-100 years in the response of plant species diversity to changing configuration of habitats in the landscape. When analyzing remnants of traditionally managed seminatural grasslands in Sweden, we found that species diversity was not related to present-day connectivity of the investigated sites, irrespective of spatial scale (3.1-12.5 km(2)). However, when using maps depicting landscapes 50 and 100 years ago, respectively, strong positive effects of habitat connectivity appeared, at increasing spatial scale for the older landscapes. Thus, analyses of how species diversity relates to present-day landscapes may be misleading, and future species loss may be expected even if the present landscape is maintained.",NA,NA,"2004","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2004 JUL","ECOLOGY","85","7","1840","1845","10.1890/04-0367","0012-9658","WOS:000223113500017","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lindborg, R et al.

Whether such changes modify interactions between species and the networks in which they are embedded remain fundamental questions to assess the health and ecosystem functionality of logged forests. We focus on interactions between lianas and their tree hosts within primary and selectively logged forests in the biodiversity hotspot of Malaysian Borneo. We found that lianas were more abundant, had higher species richness and different species compositions in logged than in primary forests. Logged forests showed heavier liana loads disparately affecting slow-growth tree species, which could exacerbate the loss of timber value and carbon storage already associated to logging. Moreover, simulation scenarios of host tree local species loss indicated that logging might decrease the robustness of liana-tree interaction networks if heavily infested trees (i.e. the most connected ones) are more likely to disappear. This effect is partially mitigated in the short term by the colonization of host trees by a greater diversity of liana species within logged forests, yet this might not compensate for the loss of preferred tree hosts in the long term. As a consequence, species interaction networks may show a lagged response to disturbance, which may trigger sudden collapses in species richness and ecosystem function in response to additional disturbances, representing a new type of extinction debt. borneo datasetIncludes liana and tree species, DBH and host used by lianas across 120 sample plots in primary and logged forest Copyright: CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication",NA,NA,"2016",NA,"2016","Dryad",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.5061/DRYAD.6V75K",NA,"DRCI:DATA2016117009608730",NA,"Data set",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Magrach, Ainhoa et al.

Resource competition (R) theory can describe dynamics within patches or hosts, while metacommunity dynamics describe competition-colonization tradeoffs, extinction debts, and superinfection. However, models at this broader scale often assume instantaneous competitive exclusion in co-inhabited patches or coinfected hosts. Impacts of more gradual competitive exclusion on the abundance, distribution, and diversity of species are less clear. Here, we nest a general resource competition model within a metacommunity framework and manipulate the relative timescales for processes operating within and among patches/hosts. We focus on superinfection in pathogen communities. We compare cases where transmission depends on infection prevalence versus the abundance of pathogens within hosts. Surprisingly, slowing the relative pace of competitive exclusion within hosts can decrease infection prevalence of the inferior competitor and increase prevalence of the superior competitor, depending on transmission and virulence. Slower dynamics reduce the abundance of both pathogens within hosts and promote diversity at multiple scales: coinfections within individual hosts and co-occurrence in the host population. These results highlight surprising feedbacks that can emerge across scales and reinforce the rich cross-scale connections between community and disease ecology.

To effectively plan for landscape-scale restoration efforts, decision makers need to prioritise where restoration should occur and have a method to estimate its cost. Here, we describe a systematic approach to determine where cost-effective restoration actions should be located to achieve targeted levels of ecosystem coverage across Australia without compromising agricultural production. We find that spending approximately AU$2 billion (0.1% of Australia's 2019 Gross Domestic Product) annually for 30 years could restore 13 million ha of degraded land without affecting intensive agriculture and urban areas. This initiative would result in almost all (99.8%) of Australia's degraded terrestrial ecosystems reaching 30% vegetation coverage, enabling a trajectory to recover critical ecological functions, abate almost one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and produce AU$12-46 billion net present value in carbon offset revenue. The carbon market revenue is estimated to cover up to 111% of the investment required for the restoration. Our research shows that the recovery of degraded ecosystems in Australia is both attainable and affordable. Synthesis and applications. With growing international restoration commitments, governments and environmental organisations need methods to plan and budget their commitments.

Essentially, the possible patterns of plant community assemblies are nonrandom species loss (nestedness) and species turnover. Plant community assemblies in human-mediated land use have a combination of both nestedness and turnover. This is because of historical effects that cause nonrandom species loss due to previous and/or original habitat quality and because of direct effects of human activities that cause species turnover. We investigated the complexity of the process of plant community assemblage in a paddy field, which is a typical agricultural land use in the monsoon season in central Japan. Using multi-temporal plant monitoring records, we tested the relationship between the ratio of species nestedness/turnover through multi-temporal and both the original habitat conditions and the extent of human modification. The findings revealed that paddy fields that originated from wetland habitat had a high nestedness ratio, whereas paddy fields that were largely consolidated had a high turnover ratio. Thus, we could divide the community assembly processes in human-mediated land use based on original habitat conditions and human activities. This concept could help land managers establish conservation and/or restoration plans that take into account community assembly.",NA,NA,"2020","NATURE RESEARCH","2020 SEP 9","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","10","1",NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-020-71958-z","2045-2322","WOS:000571833300016","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Article","BERLIN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Osawa, Takeshi et al.

Quantitative syntheses provide a fundamental tool by taking information from multiple sources to identify generalisable patterns.

To make robust predictions about climate-related colonizations and extinctions, it is vital to understand the dynamics of range edges. This study is among the first to examine annual dynamics of cold and warm range edges, as most global change studies average observational data over space or over time. We analyzed annual range edge dynamics of marine fishes-both at the individual species level and pooled into cold- and warm-edge assemblages-in a multi-decade time-series of trawl surveys conducted on the Northeast US Shelf during a period of rapid warming. We tested whether cold edges show stronger evidence of climate tracking than warm edges (due to non-climate processes or time lags at the warm edge; the biogeography hypothesis or extinction debt hypothesis), or whether they tracked temperature change equally (due to the influence of habitat suitability; the ecophysiology hypothesis). In addition to exploring correlations with regional temperature change, we calculated species- and assemblage-specific sea bottom and sea surface temperature isotherms and used them to predict range edge position. Cold edges shifted further and tracked sea surface and bottom temperature isotherms to a greater degree than warm edges. Mixed-effects models revealed that for a one-degree latitude shift in isotherm position, cold edges shifted 0.47 degrees of latitude, and warm edges shifted only 0.28 degrees. Our results suggest that cold range edges are tracking climate change better than warm range edges, invalidating the ecophysiology hypothesis. We also found that even among highly mobile marine ectotherms in a global warming hotspot, few species are fully keeping pace with climate.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 MAY","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","26","5","2908","2922","10.1111/gcb.15035","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000526102300016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Fredston-Hermann, Alexa et al.

The increase in invasion levels might not be immediate but rather exhibit a time-lag (i.e. invasion debt). Moreover, the relationship between invasion and landscape history (i.e. changes in landscape composition) might be extremely complex as it might also include extinction debts of invasive species currently in regression. In order to understand the effect of landscape history on plant invasion, we studied the invasion level in coastal plant communities affected by intense human-driven landscape alteration in the last 50 years. We identified all non-native plant species within 809 grid cells (250 x 250 m) along similar to 500 km of the Spanish SW coast. We tested the association of (1) non-native richness conditional on the overall presence of non-natives (at least one species), and (2) the occurrence of the most frequent non-native species, with the percentage of human land-cover categories in 1956, 1991 and 2007 using a multimodel inference approach. We used these models to project future invasion patterns in the region. We found non-native richness to be more associated with land-cover variables in 1956 than in 2007, suggesting the existence of an invasion debt, but not for the overall presence of non-natives. For most frequent species, the effects of past landscape alteration depended on the introduction pathway and the region of origin. Species used in agriculture were more related to past cropland area, while most of the species used in gardening or forestry showed higher affinity for recently altered areas.

Expansion rates increased with the area, quality and proximity of habitat patches available for colonization, with predicted expansion rates closely matching observed rates in test landscapes.

"JOUR",NA,"Hui Cang and Li Zi-zhen and Han Xiao-zhuo and Zhang Feng","Theoretical framework of metapopulation and progress in application","Metapopulation is the important frontiers and hotspots in recent international research of ecology. With the global habitat destruction and fragmentation, metapopulation approaches have become one of the most important tools in mathematical ecology,theoretical ecology and conservation biology. Due to the quick development, the concepts and theories of metapopulation expand and thrive. To snake a comprehensive view of metapopulation researches, we fully analyze and summarize the present concepts, theories and models of metapopulation in this paper, which primarily includes the dynamical models and simulation approaches of single and competitive metapopulations. Based on the Levin's patch occupant model,the center framework of metapopulation researches, primary principles and mechanisms are discussed. First, Levins rule: the fraction of empty patch will remain constant with habitat destruction as long as metapopulation survives. This rule implies that empty patches have determinant effects on persistence and conservation. Second, Allee effect of metapopulation is incurred by establishing difficulties and dispersal costs, which is important to the studies of reserve area and the minimum available metapopulation size. Third,we analyze the rescue effect that immigrants can reduce the extinction risk of the presented local population. Rescue effect can leads to the improvement of metapopulation sustainability and the decrease of fraction of empty patches. Fourth, the coexistence mechanism of two competing metapopulation is discussed, which suggests that competition-colonization trade-off may be prevalent in competing systems. Finally, extinction debt obtained from coexistence mechanism is given,which depicts the lost of species richness in the future for the current habitat destruction. After theoretical discussion, we present two popular simulated approaches in metapopulations : probability transition model and stochastic process model. In the final section, we compactly prospect the development and application of metapopulation approach. We hope that this paper could be a synthetically consultation to further metapopulation researches.",NA,NA,"2004",NA,"2004","Xibei Zhiwu Xuebao","24","3","551","557",NA,"1000-4025","BCI:BCI200400327089",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hui Cang et al.

However, disentangling the precise factors that determine recruitment success in species that critically rely on mycorrhizal fungi represents a major challenge. In this study, we used seed germination experiments, 454 amplicon pyrosequencing and assessment of soil conditions to investigate the factors driving changes in local abundance in 28 populations of the orchid Neottia ovata. Comparison of population sizes measured in 2003 and 2013 showed that nearly 60% of the studied populations had declined in size (average growth rate across all populations: -0.01). Investigation of the mycorrhizal fungi in both the roots and soil revealed a total of 68 species of putatively mycorrhizal fungi, 21 of which occurred exclusively in roots, 25 that occurred solely in soil and 22 that were observed in both the soil and roots. Seed germination was limited and significantly and positively related to soil moisture content and soil pH, but not to fungal community composition. Large populations or populations with high population growth rates showed significantly higher germination than small populations or populations declining in size, but no significant relationships were found between population size or growth and mycorrhizal diversity. Overall, these results indicate that temporal changes in abundance were related to the ability of seeds to germinate, but at the same time they provided limited evidence that variation in fungal communities played an important role in determining population dynamics.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 JUL","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","24","13","3269","3280","10.1111/mec.13236","0962-1083 and 1365-294X","WOS:000356973100007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jacquemyn, Hans et al.

To study succession, long-term field observations or simulation models are used but data, knowledge or resources to run such models are often scarce in tropical areas. We propose and implement a species accounting equation, which includes the co-occurring events extinction, colonization and recruitment and which can be solved by using data from a single inventory. We solved this species accounting equation for the 12 remaining Afromontane cloud forest relicts in Taita Hills, Kenya by comparing the tree species present among the seedling, sapling and mature tree layer in 82 plots. A simultaneous ordination of the seedling, sapling and mature tree layer data revealed that potential species extinctions, colonizations and recruitments may induce future species shifts. On landscape level, the potential extinction debt amounted to 9% (7 species) of the regional species pool. On forest relict level, the smallest relicts harbored an important proportion of the tree species diversity in the regeneration layer. The average potential recruitment credit, defined as species only present as seedling or sapling, was 3 and 6 species for large and small forest relicts, while the average potential extinction debt was 12 and 4 species, respectively. In total, both large and small relicts are expected to lose approximately 20% of their current local tree species pool. The species accounting equations provide a time and resource effective tool and give an improved understanding of the conservation status and possible future succession dynamics of forest relicts, which can be particularly useful in a context of participatory monitoring.",NA,NA,"2014","ELSEVIER GMBH","2014","BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY","15","4","288","296","10.1016/j.baae.2014.05.004","1439-1791 and 1618-0089","WOS:000340140900002","HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY","Article","MUNICH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Thijs, Koen W. et al.

We review 3 areas in which principles of landscape ecology might be applied to the scientific understanding and management of freshwater mussels. First, recent studies show that hydraulics can be used successfully to delineate patches of mussel habitat, but additional variables such as host fish, food, or predators are probably important under certain conditions. However, research on patch dynamics in freshwater mussels is in its infancy, and we do not know if existing methods to delineate patches are adequate. Second, mussel ecologists are starting to think about the importance of connectivity among habitat patches. Major challenges will be to determine whether connectivity can be estimated in the field and whether human activities that reduce connectivity (e.g., dams) have produced large extinction debts in mussel populations. Third, we need to better understand the links between events on the watershed (e.g., timing and amounts of water, nutrient, and sediment inputs) and the quality, extent, location, and connections among patches of mussel habitats. Because of its focus on patterns and processes, landscape ecology has the potential to improve scientific understanding and management of mussel populations and, in particular, to help define the best spatial scales for scientific studies and management activities.",NA,NA,"2008","NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC","2008 JUN","JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY","27","2","424","439","10.1899/07-076.1","0887-3593","WOS:000256178200015","1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","Review","LAWRENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Newton, Teresa J. et al.

Both conservationists and ecologists need ecologically relevant metrics to quantify the condition of plant and animal communities. However, current metrics fail to address the invasion of species native to different community types in the same region, even though these native aliens' can serve as valuable indicators of recent changes in habitat condition. We propose a novel approach to reconceptualize community biodiversity based on the composition of historically developed habitat-specific species pools. Total observed community diversity can be divided to characteristic diversity, consisting of species belonging to habitat-specific species pool, and derived diversity, consisting of either native or non-native species not typical to a given community and whose presence is driven by adverse human impact. Characteristic and derived diversity in communities have different historical backgrounds; thus, the ecological patterns of these components, effects on ecosystem functioning as well as actions necessary for their conservation are likewise different. We propose the Index of Favourable Conservation Status - the log ratio of characteristic to derived diversity - as an easily quantified, ecologically relevant and universal indicator of biodiversity integrity and community condition. The Index of Favourable Conservation Status provides valuable information on habitat conservation needs and recent adverse human impact in relative terms and can be compared between regions and across a wide range of ecosystems. It can also be used to monitor restoration success or characterize biodiversity degradation. We present standardized procedure of determining habitat-specific species pools and bring several examples of how the concept of characteristic and derived diversity can be applied in conservation and research and how expert knowledge on habitat-specific species pool composition can expand our understanding of community biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 JUN","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","21","6","711","721","10.1111/ddi.12285","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000354186200010","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Helm, Aveliina et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Stork, Nigel E.","Re-assessing current extinction rates","There is a widespread belief that we are experiencing a mass extinction event similar in severity to previous mass extinction events in the last 600 million years where up to 95% of species disappeared. This paper reviews evidence for current extinctions and different methods of assessing extinction rates including species-area relationships and loss of tropical forests, changing threat status of species, co-extinction rates and modelling the impact of climate change. For 30 years some have suggested that extinctions through tropical forest loss are occurring at a rate of up to 100 species a day and yet less than 1,200 extinctions have been recorded in the last 400 years. Reasons for low number of identified global extinctions are suggested here and include success in protecting many endangered species, poor monitoring of most of the rest of species and their level of threat, extinction debt where forests have been lost but species still survive, that regrowth forests may be important in retaining 'old growth' species, fewer co-extinctions of species than expected, and large differences in the vulnerability of different taxa to extinction threats. More recently, others have suggested similar rates of extinction to earlier estimates but with the key cause of extinction being climate change, and in particular rising temperatures, rather than deforestation alone. Here I suggest that climate change, rather than deforestation is likely to bring about such high levels of extinction since the impacts of climate change are local to global and that climate change is acting synergistically with a range of other threats to biodiversity including deforestation.",NA,NA,"2010","SPRINGER","2010 FEB","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","19","2","357","371","10.1007/s10531-009-9761-9","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000273978600005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Review","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Stork, Nigel E.

"JOUR",NA,"Ovaskainen, O and Hanski, I","Transient dynamics in metapopulation response to perturbation","Transient time in population dynamics refers to the time it takes for a population to return to population-dynamic equilibrium (or close to it) following a perturbation in the environment or in population size. Depending on the direction of the perturbation, transient time may either denote the time until extinction (or until the population has decreased to a lower equilibrium level), or the recovery time needed to reach a higher equilibrium level. In the metapopulation context, the length of the transient time is set by the interplay between population dynamics and landscape structure. Assuming a spatially realistic metapopulation model, we show that transient time is a product of four factors: the strength of the perturbation, the ratio between the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and a threshold value determined by the properties of the species, and the characteristic turnover rate of the species, adjusted by a factor depending on the structure of the habitat patch network. Transient time is longest following a large perturbation, for a species which is close to the threshold for persistence, for a species with slow turnover, and in a habitat patch network consisting of only a few dynamically important patches. We demonstrate that the essential behaviour of the n-dimensional spatially realistic Levins model is captured by the one-dimensional Levins model with appropriate parameter transformations.

"JOUR",NA,"Schleuning, Matthias and Matthies, Diethart","Habitat Change and Plant Demography: Assessing the Extinction Risk of a Formerly Common Grassland Perennial","An important aim of conservation biology is to understand how habitat change affects the dynamics and extinction risk of populations. We used matrix models to analyze the effect of habitat degradation on the demography of the declining perennial plant Trifolium montanum in 9 calcareous grasslands in Germany over 4 years and experimentally tested the effect of grassland management. Finite population growth rates (lambda) decreased with light competition, measured as leaf-area index above T. montanum plants. At unmanaged sites lambda was < 1 due to lower recruitment and lower survival and flowering probability of large plants. Nevertheless, in stochastic simulations, extinction of unmanaged populations of 100 flowering plants was delayed for several decades. Clipping as a management technique rapidly increased population growth because of higher survival and flowering probability of large plants in managed than in unmanaged plots. Transition-matrix simulations from these plots indicated grazing or mowing every second year would be sufficient to ensure a growth rate >= 1 if conditions stayed the same. At frequently grazed sites, the finite growth rate was approximately 1 in most populations of T. montanum. In stochastic simulations, the extinction risk of even relatively small grazed populations was low, but about half the extant populations of T. montanum in central Germany are smaller than would be sufficient for a probability of survival of > 95% over 100 years. We conclude that habitat change after cessation of management strongly reduces recruitment and survival of established individuals of this perennial plant. Nevertheless, our results suggest extinction processes may take a long time in perennial plants, resulting in an extinction debt. Even if management is frequent, many remnant populations of T. montanum may be at risk because of their small size, but even a slight increase in size could considerably reduce their extinction risk.",NA,NA,"2009","WILEY","2009 FEB","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","23","1","174","183","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01054.x","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000262465500022","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Schleuning, Matthias et al.

As social-ecological systems (SESs) depend on a range of ecosystem services, lagged ecological dynamics may affect their long-term sustainability. Here, we investigate the role of consumption changes for sustainability, under a time-delayed ecological feedback on agricultural production. We use a stylized model that couples the dynamics of biodiversity, technology, human demography and compliance with a social norm prescribing sustainable consumption. Compliance with the sustainable norm reduces both the consumption footprint and the vulnerability of SESs to transient overshoot-and-collapse population crises. We show that the timing and interaction between social, demographic and ecological feedbacks govern the transient and long-term dynamics of the system. A sufficient level of social pressure (e.g. disapproval) applied on the unsustainable consumers leads to the stable coexistence of unsustainable and sustainable or mixed equilibria, where both defectors and conformers coexist. Under bi-stability conditions, increasing extinction debts reduces the resilience of the system, thus favouring abrupt regime shifts towards unsustainable pathways. Given recent evidence of large extinction debts, such results call for farsightedness and a better understanding of time delays when studying the sustainability of coupled SESs.",NA,NA,"2017","ROYAL SOC","2017 DEC 6","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","284","1868",NA,NA,"10.1098/rspb.2017.1192","0962-8452 and 1471-2954","WOS:000417194500004","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","Article","LONDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lafuite, A. -S. et al.

Here, we describe the long-term metapopulation study of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) that has been conducted since 1991 in a large network of 4000 habitat patches (dry meadows) within a study area of 50 by 70km in the angstrom land Islands in Finland. We explain how the landscape structure has been described, including definition, delimitation, and mapping of the habitat patches; methods of field survey, including the logistics, cost, and reliability of the survey; and data management using the EarthCape biodiversity platform. We describe the long-term metapopulation dynamics of the Glanville fritillary based on the survey. There has been no long-term change in the overall size of the metapopulation, but the level of spatial synchrony and hence the amplitude of fluctuations in year-to-year metapopulation dynamics have increased over the years, possibly due to increasing frequency of exceptional weather conditions. We discuss the added value of large-scale and long-term population studies, but also emphasize the need to integrate more targeted experimental studies in the context of long-term observational studies. For instance, in the case of the Glanville fritillary project, the long-term study has produced an opportunity to sample individuals for experiments from local populations with a known demographic history. These studies have demonstrated striking differences in dispersal rate and other life-history traits of individuals from newly established local populations (the offspring of colonizers) versus individuals from old, established local populations. The long-term observational study has stimulated the development of metapopulation models and provided an opportunity to test model predictions.

At the global scale, future declines in plant species diversity are highly likely given habitat conversion in the tropics, although few extinctions have been documented for the Anthropocene to date (<0.1%). Nonnative species introductions have greatly increased plant species richness in many regions of the world at the same time that they have led to the creation of new hybrid polyploid species by bringing previously isolated congeners into close contact. At the local scale, conversion of primary vegetation to agriculture has decreased plant diversity, whereas other drivers of change-e.g., climate warming, habitat fragmentation, and nitrogen deposition-have highly context-dependent effects, resulting in a distribution of temporal trends with a mean close to zero.

This is the reason why many nature reserves have been established in these landscapes. Currently, climate change and long-range transport of contaminants are affecting those protected areas, and thus conservation priorities may be challenged by these new pressures. In fact, many high mountains hold a legacy of on-site past human activities (e.g., pasturing, forestry, mining), which in some areas may partially persist, even increase, whereas in others are substituted by new uses (e.g., tourism, mountain sport). Therefore, high mountain nature reserves face a challenging future. The conservation goals have to be revised. Former alternative paradigms respectively based on the preservation of wilderness or a traditional cultural landscape will be insufficient. Indeed, global change provides new goals for the high mountain conservation areas as suitable places where to study the nature's response in the absence of, or combined with, other local pressures. Different branches of sciences may contribute to inform about the changes; however, conservation is ultimately a societal endeavour and thus their goals must be linked to the social demand for a fair society in a sustainable planet.

As knowledge of grassland insect communities is limited, the lag between the initiation of restoration and the ability of these new habitats to contribute to the successful enhancement of native biodiversity is unclear. Using two long term data sets from the same restoration experiment, we investigate differences in successional trajectories during the establishment of butterfly (11 years) and phytophagous beetle (13 years) during the recreation of calcareous grassland. Overall restoration success was higher for the butterflies than for the beetles. However, both shared the same general pattern of rapidly increasing restoration success over the first five years, which approached an asymptote after c. 10 years. The use of pro-active grassland restoration to mitigate against future environmental change needs to account for such time lags if the value of these habitats is to be fully realised.",NA,NA,"2012","Association of Applied Biologists","2012","Aspects of Applied Biology",NA,"115","47","51",NA,"0265-1491","CABI:20123305216","Wellesbourne","Journal article and Conference paper",NA,NA,NA,"Peel.

We tested alternative hypotheses for how the abundance of a suite of declining songbirds in relation to energy development changed over time. We conducted point counts at two natural gas fields during two periods spanning a decade (2008-2009 and 2018-2019), and compared the abundance of sagebrush songbirds across a gradient of surface disturbance between study periods (trend-by-time). We also assessed changes in the abundance of birds between study periods relative to additional development that had occurred (trend-over-time). We predicted that abundance responses to surface disturbance would be more negative during the second period, regardless of additional disturbance that had occurred, because of previously observed inverse relationships between surface disturbance and nest survival at our sites. Contrary to our predictions, abundance responses attenuated by the second time period for two of three species, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrasher (the latter at one energy field only). Sagebrush sparrow abundance, however, consistently decreased with surface disturbance within and between periods. Sage thrasher abundance consistently decreased with surface disturbance at one of the gas fields, and the probability of colonization by thrashers between study periods was lower where additional surface disturbance had occurred.

However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points.

Their restoration supports arthropod biodiversity within farming systems. We investigated limiting factors for arthropod establishment during grassland restoration across a chronosequence of 52 restoration sites established by either natural regenerating or direct seeding. Our study covered 363 arthropod species of 10 orders, including detritivores, herbivores, predators and pollinators. These were sampled using pitfall traps, suction sampling and transect walks. The similarity of plant communities on restoration sites to target species rich grasslands was positively correlated with the similarity of the arthropod communities to these same grasslands. There was evidence that restoration sites located in landscapes suffering from historic large-scale loss of species rich grassland (1930-2015) had lower success in replicating the composition of arthropod communities and supported the lowest levels of species richness. The age of the restoration site was a predictor of restoration success for some trophic levels. For example, predator species richness was greatest in the oldest restoration sites. However, this was only the case were sites were either of large size or located in landscapes with the lowest historic loss of species rich grassland. Impacts of within site management also affected arthropod communities. The annual frequency of cutting negatively affected detritivores species richness, and selected against traits including herbivore monophagy. Overall arthropod species richness was positively correlated with sward height. These results emphasise the relative importance of the success with which the floral community is replicated, as well as landscape and management factors, during grassland restoration. This has implications for future agri-environmental schemes. In particular, achieving high quality within-site management that maximises establishment of the plant communities needs to be the initial focus of any restoration program.",NA,NA,"2021","ELSEVIER","2021 MAR 1","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","308",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.agee.2020.107271","0167-8809 and 1873-2305","WOS:000604619300006","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Woodcock, B.

First, it is unclear whether increasing the complexity of spatial models to include age structure enhances our ability to predict population growth in temporally varying environments. Second, if simulations of individual behavior are used to identify options for landscape management, predictions about the fate of dispersing organisms are likely to be hugely in error unless dispersal attributes are known to a far greater degree of accuracy than is reasonable to expect. Third, the compelling metaphor of extinction debts resulting from habitat destruction in competitive communities stands firm as a cautionary tale even when the metapopulation models include multiple trophic levels - but the question remains of how widespread and tight are the tradeoffs between dispersal capacity and competitive superiority. Given the shakiness of spatial models as a foundation for specific conservation recommendations, we conclude they may be more useful as a tool for exploring the design of spatially-structured monitoring schemes, so that management mistakes might be detected before they become irreversible.",NA,NA,"1995","MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD","1995 DEC","OIKOS","74","3","349","356","10.2307/3545979","0030-1299","WOS:A1995TW28700002","35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","Article and Proceedings Paper","COPENHAGEN",NA,"Summer School on Evolution and Population Dynamics in Spatially Structured Environments",NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Wennergren, U et al.

For our first annual survey, we compiled data across all 50 states during a 14-week period (17 August-24 November of 2019). We sampled wildlife at 1,509 camera trap sites from 110 camera trap arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across four development zones. This effort resulted in 166,036 unique detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. All images were processed through the Smithsonian's eMammal camera trap data repository and included an expert review phase to ensure taxonomic accuracy of data, resulting in each picture being reviewed at least twice. The results represent a timely and standardized camera trap survey of the United States. All of the 2019 survey data are made available herein. We are currently repeating surveys in fall 2020, opening up the opportunity to other institutions and cooperators to expand coverage of all the urban-wild gradients and ecophysiographic regions of the country.

In Europe, their extent was mostly reduced to isolated habitat patches, whose biota is subject to extinction debt. Knowledge on requirements of dry-grassland inhabitants is thus vital to slow down decline of grassland biodiversity. We studied habitat requirements of eight flightless steppe beetles, including some of the most endangered dry-grassland specialists of the continent. The beetles were sampled using 167 pitfall traps at a pannonian dry-grassland fragment, the Pouzdrany steppe, SE Czech Republic, from March to November 2006. The number of each species captures in each trap was related to vegetation and abiotic habitat characteristics; captures of all beetles were related to each other. Two of the studied species required relatively humid microhabitats, including tall-grass steppe with litter (Carabus hungaricus, Carabidae) and grassland of high herb cover (Meloe proscarabaeus, Meloidae). Others were associated with xeric habitats (e.g. Meloe scabriusculus) and their early-successional stages, including short-turf vegetation (Dorcadion fulvum, D. pedestre, Cerambycidae) and/or bare-ground patches (Blaps lethifera, Tenebrionidae; Meloe decorus, M. uralensis). Our findings point to key importance of early-successional vegetation for grassland biodiversity, and to the fact that locally co-occurring and closely related grassland specialists may exhibit contrasting habitat needs. Spatially and temporarily highly diversified patch management creating a fine scale mosaic of various seral stages from bare soil to tall-grass steppe is therefore the most appropriate approach for managing isolated grasslands. Prescribed burning and support of burrowing herbivores are recommended and discussed together with other measures for restoration of habitat diversity in dry-grassland fragments.",NA,NA,"2012","SPRINGER","2012 APR","JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION","16","2","281","293","10.1007/s10841-011-9415-6","1366-638X","WOS:000301588900012","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cizek, Lukas et al.

Thus conservation geneticists must consider the time scale over which contemporary evolutionary processes operate to accurately portray the effects of habitat isolation. Here, we examine the genetic impacts of fragmentation on the Florida sand skink Plestiodon reynoldsi, a sand swimming lizard that is highly adapted to the upland scrub habitat of central Florida. We studied fragments located on the southern Lake Wales Ridge, where human activity in the latter half of the 20th century has modified the natural patchiness of the landscape. Based on a relaxed molecular clock method, we estimate that sand skinks have persisted in this region for approximately 1.5 million years and that the time frame of human disturbance is equivalent to fewer than 30 skink generations. Using genotypes from eight microsatellite loci, we screened for molecular signatures of this disturbance by assessing congruence between population structure, as inferred from spatially-informed Bayesian assignment tests, and the current geography of scrub fragments. We also tested for potential intrapopulation genetic effects of inbreeding in isolated populations by comparing the average pairwise relatedness of individuals within fragments of different areas and isolation. Our results indicate that although some patches show a higher degree of relatedness than expected under random mating, the genetic effects of recent isolation are not evident in this part of the species' range. We argue that this result is an artefact of a time-lag in the response to disturbance, and that species-typical demographic features may explain the genetic inertia observed in these populations.",NA,NA,"2009","SPRINGER","2009 OCT","CONSERVATION GENETICS","10","5","1281","1297","10.1007/s10592-008-9707-x","1566-0621 and 1572-9737","WOS:000270737400009","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Richmond, Jonathan Q. et al.

Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

Is there a delayed functional response to fragmentation?Location: Thirty remnant Banksia woodlands, Perth, Australia.Methods: We used GLMM to examine the effects of remnant age and area, and their interaction, on the relative abundance and functional diversity (FD) of five plant functional traits: growth form, pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration strategies. We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances.Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs, root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes, ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub pollination and nutrient acquisition traits.Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may occur. Finally, the study shows how cities' fragmentation history and biogeographic settings provide an important context influencing plant functional responses to urbanization-related processes.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 MAR","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","29","2","285","296","10.1111/jvs.12615","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000431503000016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ramalho, Cristina E. et al.

This sequence of land-use change has a severe impact on vegetation and is likely to initiate secondary succession and is possibly leading to an impoverishment in species diversity and to taxonomic homogenisation.Aims: We assess the impact of agricultural use and subsequent abandonment on vegetation composition in a percolation fen in north Germany and characterise successional changes and changes in abiotic site conditions.Methods: In 2010, we resampled 77 plots of a phytosociological survey from 1967-1970 in a lowland percolation mire complex in the lower Recknitz valley, north-east Germany. These included three characteristic vegetation types of percolation fens. To investigate and quantify vegetation changes we used dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and ecological species indicator values.Results: Overall species richness declined only slightly while there was a more pronounced decrease in species richness at the plot level in all recorded vegetation types, resulting in increased beta diversity. Generalist and nitrophilous species increased in abundance, indicating ongoing succession.Conclusions: Drainage for agricultural use and subsequent abandonment has long-lasting effects. Altered hydrological and nutrient status of the fen soil has initiated secondary succession. There is indication of an extinction debt that in the future may lead to an impoverishment of species diversity in the area. Conservation of open mesotrophic fen species may thus only be achieved if moderate use is continued and hydrologic conservation measures are applied on wide contiguous areas.",NA,NA,"2015","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","2015 JAN 2","PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY","8","1","49","60","10.1080/17550874.2013.862752","1755-0874 and 1755-1668","WOS:000349391800001","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","ABINGDON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Koch, Marian et al.

We measured alpha (site) and gamma (catchment) richness annually over a nine-year period in all the streams, ponds and ditches in three upper-catchments in the English lowlands, and investigated whether freshwater plant biodiversity could be increased by adding: (i) multifunctional ecosystem services measures to intercept pollutants, store water and promote biodiversity, and, (ii) biodiversity-only protection measures. In the absence of measures, all catchments saw a decline in macrophyte richness during the survey (mean species loss of 1% pa, rare species loss of 2% pa). Ponds were a key habitat with a disproportionate influence on catchment trends. Five years after introducing measures, natural colonisation of ecosystem services waterbodies (dammed streams and ditches, runoff ponds, flood storage ponds) largely cancelled-out the background loss of plant species but, importantly, did not restore the loss of rare plants. Adding clean water ponds as a biodiversity-only enhancement measure brought substantial benefits: increasing total-catchment richness by 26%, and the number of rare plant species by 181%. Populations of spatially restricted species also increased. Adding stream debris-dams as a biodiversity measure did not affect plant richness or rarity. The findings suggest that ecosystem services measures could bring some biodiversity benefits to agricultural catchments. However, creating clean-water ponds specifically targeted for biodiversity could hold considerable potential as a tool to help stem, and even reverse, ongoing declines in freshwater plant biodiversity across farming landscapes.",NA,NA,"2020","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2020 APR","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","244",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108515","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","WOS:000526787400014","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Williams, Penny et al.

"DATA",NA,"Semper-Pascual, Asuncion","Data from: How do habitat amount and habitat fragmentation drive time-delayed responses of biodiversity to land-use change?","Land-use change is a root cause of the extinction crisis, but links between habitat change and biodiversity loss are not fully understood. While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time-delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss vs. fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi- species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985-2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss vs. fragmentation studies. Biodiversity data: Birds were recorded at 233 sites during three field surveys between 2009 and 2014, with a mean distance of 4.7-km between sites (standard deviation: SD=6.5-km). We conducted point counts at each site (two to nine point counts per site). Here, we only considered species that use woodland as their main habitat, as this is by far the dominant natural vegetation in the area and we wanted to test for time-delayed responses to woodland loss and fragmentation. We discarded migrant species to avoid seasonal effects and species associated with the Andean Cloud forest (i.e., Yungas) that were only recorded in the Chaco-Yungas ecotone. Mammals were surveyed during two field surveys between 2013 and 2016, using a total of 198 camera-trap stations. The mean distance between adjacent sites was 1.44-km (SD=1.74). We set cameras off trail where possible, to reduce detection bias associated with targeted sampling. Cameras were active between 14 and 84 trapping days (mean=39.8 days), with a total sampling effort of 7,883 trapping days. We only considered woodland-dependent mammal species. Landscape predictors: We calculated landscape-scale metrics of habitat amount and fragmentation, meaning that they described the spatial characteristics of entire landscapes, not individual patches. We extracted predictors for circular landscapes centered around each sampling site. Based on sensitivity analyses, we used a 4-km radius for birds, and a 2-km radius for mammals.We calculated one landscape predictor representing habitat amount: percentage of woodland. To characterize fragmentation, we calculated three predictors: percentage of edge, patch density and cohesion index. To define the contemporary landscape predictors, we related each site to the landscape predictors of the year when biodiversity was sampled (e.g., sites sampled in 2015 were related to the predictors from 2015). We then derived a time series of past landscape predictors 24 years back in time (i.e., landscape patterns from 1 year prior to sampling, 2 years prior to sampling, etc.). We used a maximum time period of 24 years because this is the time span between the oldest Landsat-based woodland map (1985) and the oldest biodiversity sampling (2009) in our dataset.

"JOUR",NA,"Halley, John M. and Iwasa, Yoh","Neutral theory as a predictor of avifaunal extinctions after habitat loss","The worldwide loss of natural habitats leads not only to the loss of habitat-endemic species but also to further and protracted extinctions in the reduced areas that remain. How rapid is this process? We use the neutral theory of biodiversity to answer this question, and we compare the results taken with observed rates of avifaunal extinctions. In the neutral model, we derive an exact solution for the rate of species loss in a closed community. The simple, closed-form solution exhibits hyperbolic decay of species richness with time, which implies a potentially rapid initial decline followed by much slower rates long term. Our empirical estimates of extinction times are based on published studies for avifaunal extinctions either on oceanic islands or in forest fragments, which span a total of six orders of magnitude in area. These estimates show that the time to extinction strongly depends on the area. The neutral-theory predictions agree well with observed rates over three orders of magnitude of area (between 100 and 100,000 ha) both for islands and forest fragments. Regarding the species abundance distribution, extinction times based on a broken-stick model led to better agreement with observation than if a log-series model was used. The predictions breakdown for very small or very large areas. Thus, neutrality may be an affordable assumption for some applications in ecology and conservation, particularly for areas of intermediate size.",NA,NA,"2011","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2011 FEB 8","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","108","6","2316","2321","10.1073/pnas.1011217108","0027-8424","WOS:000287084500029","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Halley, John M. et al.

The no-lag hypothesis is the foundation of many ecophysiological models, correlative species distribution modelling and climate reconstruction approaches. Simple lag hypotheses have become prominent in disequilibrium ecology, proposing that communities track climate change following a fixed function or with a time delay. However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models.

We also tested whether the landscape effect on species richness is different for forest and edge species. We estimated species richness from 113 forest sites in four regions in Northern Europe. At each site, we studied two plots, one at the edge and one in the core of the forest. Total forested area and forest edge length in circles with a 1-km radius, together with plot-specific variables of environmental conditions and temporal continuity of forests, were recorded at each plot. The amount of forest and the length of the forest edge in the adjacent landscape had a significant positive effect on local species richness of all understory plant species. As expected, edge species were positively affected by increasing length of the forest edge in the landscape, but surprisingly there was no effect of forest area on species richness of forest species. Temporal forest continuity had a negative effect on species richness of edge species but no effect on species richness of forest species. Our results suggest that forest edge length had a stronger landscape effect on understory plant species richness than forest area.

Therefore, it is necessary that restoration aims at achieving high genetic diversity of plant populations in addition to the recovery of characteristic species composition and diversity. Nevertheless, species- and gene-level biodiversity are rarely examined together in the context of restoration, although high genetic diversity of plant populations is a fundamental factor ensuring long-term success of restoration. Landscape-scale dispersal is the key process linked to the recovery of vegetation and maintaining both species and genetic diversity following restoration. In fragmented landscapes, dispersal of seeds and genetic material is often disrupted, leading to failure in spontaneous recovery of species richness as well as in establishment and maintenance of genetically diverse populations. Here, we review the linkages between landscape-scale dispersal of plants and the recovery of species richness and genetic diversity of plants during habitat restoration. We propose recommendations for restoration planners and practitioners to consider while aiming to restore self-sustainable ecosystems with high species- and gene-level biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JUN","RESTORATION ECOLOGY","26",NA,"S92","S102","10.1111/rec.12634","1061-2971 and 1526-100X","WOS:000436116600004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Aavik, Tsipe et al.

A critical need in conservation biology is to determine which species are most vulnerable to extinction. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionacea) are one of the most imperilled faunal groups globally. Freshwater mussel larvae are ectoparasites on fish and depend on the movement of their hosts to maintain connectivity among local populations in a metapopulation.2. I calculated local colonisation and extinction rates for 16 mussel species from 14 local populations in the Red River drainage of Oklahoma and Texas, U.S. I used general linear models and AIC comparisons to determine which mussel life history traits best predicted local colonisation and extinction rates.3. Traits related to larval dispersal ability (host infection mode, whether a mussel species was a host generalist or specialist) were the best predictors of local colonisation.4. Traits related to local population size (regional abundance, time spent brooding) were the best predictors of local extinction. The group of fish species used as hosts by mussels also predicted local extinction and was probably related to habitat fragmentation and host dispersal abilities.5. Overall, local extinction rates exceeded local colonisation rates, indicating that local populations are becoming increasingly isolated and suffering an 'extinction debt'. This study demonstrates that analysis of species traits can be used to predict local colonisation and extinction patterns and provide insight into the long-term persistence of populations.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 MAY","FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","57","5","982","992","10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02759.x","0046-5070 and 1365-2427","WOS:000302397300008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Vaughn, Caryn C.

The Eastern Arc forests are, as are many other tropical biodiversity hotspots, highly fragmented. Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat loss and subdivision) on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests is important because forest spatial structure highly influences species richness, persistence, and extinction debt. Here we examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests at a patch scale using very high resolution aerial imagery having a spatial resolution of 0.5-1.5 m. Forest area across the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains is 405,852 ha and is distributed into 311 fragments â‰¥ 10 ha in size with a median fragment size of 84 ha. The 18 largest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains contain greater than three-quarters of total forest area. Average fragment isolation, as assessed by median distance to nearest fragment and median distance to the nearest larger fragment, is 867 and 1533 m, respectively. Of total forest area, 14% is < 100 m from the forest edge and 33% is < 300 m from the forest edge. Establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments through forest regeneration and protection of secondary regenerating forest as well as providing protected area status to the remaining non-protected forest including unprotected smaller forest fragments are important to enhancing the long-term persistence of many plant and animal species here.

We studied the colonization-extinction dynamics of eight wood-decaying fungal species in 16 old-growth forest fragments (<14 ha) over a 20-year period (1997-2017). We observed 19 extinctions and 5 colonizations; yet, the distribution of extinctions and colonizations did not differ from the one expected by chance for any of the species. Twenty-six percent of the extinctions took place in two natural fragments amid large forest-peatland complexes. Phellinus nigrolimitatus (Romell) Bourdot and Galzin decreased and Phellinus ferrugineofuscus (P. Karst.) Bourdot increased in abundance (number of logs occupied). The volume of living spruce trees in the forest fragments correlated positively with the number of logs inhabited in five of the study species. Because fragment characteristics did not affect species turnover, it seems that stochastic processes governed colonizations and extinctions.

A.","Spatial patterns of prisoner's dilemma game in metapopulations","Because to defect is the evolutionary stable strategy in the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG), understanding the mechanism generating and maintaining cooperation in PDG, i.e. the paradox of cooperation, has intrinsic significance for understanding social altruism behaviors. Spatial structure serves as the key to this dilemma. Here, we build the model of spatial PDG under a metapopulation framework: the sub-populations of cooperators and defectors obey the rules in spatial PDG as well as the colonization-extinction process of metapopulations. Using the mean-field approximation and the pair approximation, we obtain the differential equations for the dynamics of occupancy and spatial correlation. Cellular automaton is also built to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spatial PDG in metapopulations. Join-count statistics are used to measure the spatial correlation as well as the spatial association of the metapopulation. Simulation results show that the distribution is self-organized and that it converges to a static boundary due to the boycotting of cooperators to defectors. Metapopulations can survive even when the colonization rate is lower than the extinction rate due to the compensation of cooperation rewards for extinction debt. With a change of parameters in the model, a metapopulation can consist of pure cooperators, pure defectors, or cooperator-defector coexistence. The necessary condition of cooperation evolution is the local colonization of a metapopulation. The spatial correlation between the cooperators tends to be weaker with the increase in the temptation to defect and the habitat connectivity; yet the spatial correlation between defectors becomes stronger. The relationship between spatial structure and the colonization rate is complicated, especially for cooperators. The metapopulation may undergo a temporary period of prosperity just before the extinction, even while the colonization rate is declining.",NA,NA,"2007","SPRINGER","2007 FEB","BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY","69","2","659","676","10.1007/s11538-006-9145-1","0092-8240 and 1522-9602","WOS:000244451400010","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hui, C. et al.

Objectives We investigate how changes in the spatial configuration of species-rich grasslands and related green infrastructure such as road verges, hedgerows and forest borders in three European countries have influenced landscape connectivity, and the effects on grassland plant biodiversity. Methods We mapped past and present land use for 36 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden, to estimate connectivity based on simple habitat spatial configuration (structural connectivity) and accounting for effective dispersal and establishment (functional connectivity) around focal grasslands. We used the resulting measures of landscape change to interpret patterns in plant communities. Results Increased presence of landscape connecting elements could not compensate for large scale losses of grassland area resulting in substantial declines in structural and functional connectivity. Generalist species were negatively affected by connectivity, and responded most strongly to structural connectivity, while functional connectivity determined the occurrence of grassland specialists in focal grasslands. Restored patches had more generalist species, and a lower density of grassland specialist species than ancient patches. Conclusions Protecting both species rich grasslands and dispersal pathways within landscapes is essential for maintaining grassland biodiversity. Our results show that increases in green infrastructure have not been sufficient to offset loss of semi-natural habitat, and that landscape links must be functionally effective in order to contribute to grassland diversity.",NA,NA,"2021","SPRINGER","2021 JAN","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","36","1","265","280","10.1007/s10980-020-01138-x","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000581573700001","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kimberley, Adam et al.

We analyze effects of climate warming on the composition of alpine plants communities and unravel the range filling of communities within a belt from long-term true upward shift processes. In the European Alps we re-sampled in 2003 the vegetation at sites studied in 1953 and analyzed the changes at intra- and inter-community level. Since 1953 all communities experienced a high species turnover, leading to an overall increase in species richness as new species exceeded species losses. The dominant species mainly declined allowing the potential expansion of competitors and/or of new species. The main recruitment sources are neighbor communities within the same elevation belt performing biotic exchanges with other plant communities in the same altitudinal belts. The changes of species distribution curves with elevation emphasized that more than half of the most widespread persisting species exhibited downward shifts instead of upward shifts. Upward shifts from lower elevation belts and of nonnative species were very limited. One third of the persisting species declined and could be used as a proxy to measure the extinction debt. Therefore the fate of plant communities will depend on the ability of the original species to persist and fill the available ecological gaps. Species persistence may be crucial in developing adaptation and environmental protection strategies.",NA,NA,"2014","SPRINGER","2014 MAR","CLIMATIC CHANGE","123","2","201","214","10.1007/s10584-014-1065-8","0165-0009 and 1573-1480","WOS:000332656100010","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cannone, Nicoletta et al.

Preservation of wildlife female germplasm, i.e., oocytes and embryos, is a promising biotechnological tool to conserve species' biodiversity. Other applied tools of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) which assure conservation of endangered species include artificial insemination (AI), embryo transfer technology (ETT), and sperm cryopreservation. Only a few studies show the possibility of adapting the cryopreservation techniques developed for domestic animal female genetic material for use with wild animals. Difficulty is encountered in getting samples, accesses to animals for study, and the standardization of protocols for cryopreservation of such genetic material. Our meta-analysis of the literature (published or in press) and on-going studies found that biobanking for the preservation of vital tissues of wild animals is possible. Somatic tissue sections, ovarian tissues, sperms, oocytes and embryos are potential materials for preservation by vitrification.

Human population is most widely predicted to reach 9-11 billion by 2100, when the demographic transition is expected in all but a handful of countries. Strongest population growth is in the tropics, where coral reefs face dense human population and concomitant heavy usage. In most countries, >50% will be urbanized but growth of rural population and need for food in urban centres will not alleviate pressure on reef resources. Aquaculture will alleviate some fishing pressure, but still utilizes reef surface and is also destructive. Denser coastal populations and greater wealth will lead to reef degradation by coastal construction. Denser populations inland will lead to more runoff and siltation. Effects of human perturbations can be explored with metapopulation theory since they translate to increases in patch-mortality and decreases in patch-colonization (=regeneration). All such changes will result in a habitat with overall fewer settled patches, so fewer live reefs. If rescue effects are included, bifurcations in system dynamics will allow for many empty patches and, depending on system state relative to stable and unstable equilibria, a part-empty system may either trend towards stability at higher patch occupancy or extinction. Thus, unless the disturbance history is known, it may be difficult to assess the direction of system trajectory-making management difficult. If habitat is decreased by destruction, rescue effects become even more important as extinction-debt, accumulated by efficient competitors with weaker dispersal ability, is realized. Easily visible trends in human population dynamics combined with well-established and tested ecological theory give a clear, intuitive, yet quantifiable guide to the severity of survival challenges faced by coral reefs. Management challenges and required actions can be clearly shown and, contrary to frequent claims, no scientific ambiguity exists with regards to the serious threat posed to coral reefs by humankind's continued numerical increase.",NA,NA,"2020","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","2020","POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THE REEF CRISIS","87",NA,"1","30","10.1016/bs.amb.2020.07.004","0065-2881 and 2162-5875 and 978-0-12-821529-6","WOS:000610787200002","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON EC2Y 5AS, ENGLAND","Review and Book Chapter","LONDON",NA,NA,"Riegl, BM",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Riegl, Bernhard M. et al.

The current global trend towards human population growth and widespread environmental degradation means that such areas are becoming increasingly isolated in fragmented habitat islands. In regions in which this process is well advanced a high proportion of species are thus predicted to have become restricted to protected areas. Here using uniquely detailed datasets for Britain, a region with close to the global level of percentage coverage by statutory protected areas, we determine the extent of restriction of Red List vascular plant species of conservation concern to these areas. On the basis of currently known distributions, overall our results strongly support the importance of a dual conservation strategy in Britain, in which protected areas are maintained with particular reference to those biodiversity features (such as many threatened plant species) that are highly dependent on them, and in which components of the wider landscape are also managed in such a way as to promote the abundance and distribution of such features with particular reference to those which are unlikely to persist in protected areas alone.

Yet, biodiversity scenarios have so far concentrated on climatic effects because forecasts of land use are rarely available at appropriate spatial and thematic scales. Agent-based models (ABMs) represent a potentially powerful but little explored tool for establishing thematically and spatially fine-grained land-use scenarios. Here, we use an ABM parameterized for 1,329 agents, mostly farmers, in a Central European model region, and simulate the changes to land-use patterns resulting from their response to three scenarios of changing socio-economic conditions and three scenarios of climate change until the mid of the century. Subsequently, we use species distribution models to, first, analyse relationships between the realized niches of 832 plant species and climatic gradients or land-use types, respectively, and, second, to project consequent changes in potential regional ranges of these species as triggered by changes in both the altered land-use patterns and the changing climate. We find that both drivers determine the realized niches of the studied plants, with land use having a stronger effect than any single climatic variable in the model. Nevertheless, the plants' future distributions appear much more responsive to climate than to land-use changes because alternative future socio-economic backgrounds have only modest impact on land-use decisions in the model region. However, relative effects of climate and land-use changes on biodiversity may differ drastically in other regions, especially where landscapes are still dominated by natural or semi-natural habitat. We conclude that agent-based modelling of land use is able to provide scenarios at scales relevant to individual species distribution and suggest that coupling ABMs with models of species' range change should be intensified to provide more realistic biodiversity forecasts.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 APR","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","26","4","2336","2352","10.1111/gcb.14977","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000509756400001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Dullinger, Iwona et al.

We investigate whether plant communities in rain forest fragments either diverge from, or become more similar to, plant communities in other fragments, in order to understand the biodiversity value of forest fragments. Location Rain forest fragments embedded within agricultural landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Methods We examined 14 forest fragments (39-120,000 ha) and five sites in continuous forest, and compared pre-isolation (trees >5 cm dbh) and post-isolation (seedlings <1 cm dbh) plant community composition. We used Chao-Sorensen dissimilarity metric to compute beta diversity between all pairwise combinations of sites, and then used Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling to reduce 18 pairwise values per site to a single site value, which we used to test whether fragment area and/or isolation are associated with changes in plant communities. We compare analyses for trees and seedlings, and whether community changes arise from recruitment failure. Results Seedlings in fragments have diverged most from other communities, and divergence was greatest between seedling communities in small fragments, which have not only diverged more from tree communities in the same fragment, but also from seedling communities at other sites. This finding is partly associated with recruitment failure: the number of genera represented by both trees and seedlings is positively associated with site area. Main conclusions Seedling communities are diverging in forest remnants, associated primarily with reductions in fragment area, whilst tree communities have not diverged, possibly due to extinction debts. Divergence is likely to continue as seedling cohorts mature, resulting in communities in fragments following different trajectories of change.

Remaining fragments are small, isolated, and embedded within a range of human land-use types. In this study, we ask: how should we invest conservation resources if we want to restore this landscape and prevent predicted extinctions? To answer this question, we use path analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects of forest area, forest connectivity, and matrix land-use types on species richness within five bird feeding guilds. We found that forest connectivity had a significant direct effect on insectivoresfragments that were more connected had more species of insectivores than those that were isolated. Moreover, forest area had a significant indirect effect on insectivores that was mediated through tree species richness. Larger fragments had more species of trees, which led to more species of insectivores. Fragment area, connectivity, matrix land-use type, and tree species richness had no significant effects on the species richness of frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, or generalist feeders. To conserve insectivores in coastal forests, conservation efforts should focus on maximizing fragment connectivity across the landscape, but also protect the tree community within fragments from degradation. This can be achieved by including matrix habitats that adjoin forest fragments within forest conservation and restoration plans.

Understanding the role of habitat availability and configuration on population declines is critical for guiding proactive conservation for this, and other, endangered species. We conducted population viability analysis to assess vulnerability of ten GHLT metapopulations to habitat loss and small population size. Seven metapopulations had a low risk of extirpation (or local extinction) over the next 100 years assuming no further forest loss, and even small populations could persist with immediate protection. Three metapopulations had a moderate/high risk of extirpation, suggesting extinction debt may be evident in parts of the species' range. When deforestation was assumed to continue at current rates, extirpation risk significantly increased while abundance and genetic diversity decreased for all metapopulations. Extirpation risk was significantly negatively correlated with the size of the largest patch available to metapopulations, underscoring the importance of large habitat patches for species persistence. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analysis using logistic regression, and our results showed that local extinction risk was sensitive to percentage of females breeding, adult female mortality, and dispersal rate and survival; conservation or research programs that target these aspects of the species' biology/ecology could have a disproportionately important impact on species survival.

Extinctions typically occur after a certain delay, and understanding the mechanisms causing delays is a key challenge for both fundamental and applied perspectives. Here, we make use of natural experiments, the isolation of lakes by land uplift in Northern Scandinavia, to examine how yearly extinction rates are affected by time since isolation and a range of abiotic and biotic factors. In this aim, we adapted a model of delayed species loss within isolated communities to test the effects of time since isolation, area, pH, depth and the presence/absence of piscivores on extinction rates. As expected, we found that small and/or young lakes experience a higher annual rate of extinctions per species than larger and/or older ones. Compared to previous studies that were conducted for either young (few thousand years ago) or very old (>10,000 years ago) isolates, we demonstrated over a large and continuous temporal scales (50-5,000 years), similar relationship between extinction rates and age. We also show that extinction rates are modified by local environmental factors such as a strong negative effect of increasing pH. Our results urge for the need to consider the time since critical environmental changes occurred when studying extinction rates.

The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000-5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000-8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 OCT","ECOLOGY","100","10",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecy.2817","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000482324900001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Butterfield, Bradley J. et al.

In southern Sweden, human impacts have decreased densities of old (>150 years) living trees and large (diameter at breast height >40 cm) dead trees to less than 1% of their original densities. In the same fashion, forest fires have decreased enormously in extent during the last 300 years, except in southwestern Sweden where the original fire frequency was presumably lower. These changes have had a tremendous impact on forest biodiversity. The number of extinctions in Sweden increases rapidly from the north to the south both for forest living species and other species. The number of threatened species shows a similar pattern and it is probable that many of these species belong to the extinction debt, especially those species that are dependent on sun-exposed old living and dead deciduous trees. Rapid restoration measures, such as increasing the number of old sun exposed oaks (Quercus robur) and large dead deciduous trees (e.g., Fagus) in the vicinity of existing hot-spots, may prevent some impending extinctions. Fire is important to use when managing forests for preserving biodiversity, especially in areas where fires more recently have been suppressed and where a relict fire-adapted fauna is still present.",NA,NA,"2005","Food Products Press","2005","Journal of Sustainable Forestry","21","2/3","11","43",NA,"1054-9811","CABI:20063061674","Binghamton","Journal article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Nilsson, S.

F.","Limiting factors in the restoration of UK grassland beetle assemblages","Grasslands restoration is a key management tool contributing to the long-term maintenance of insect populations, providing functional connectivity and mitigating against extinction debt across landscapes. As knowledge of grassland insect communities is limited, the lag between the initiation of restoration and the ability of these new habitats to contribute to such processes is unclear. Using ten data sets, ranging from 3 to 14 years, we investigate the lag between restoration and the establishment of phytophagous beetle assemblages typical of species rich grasslands. We used traits and ecological characteristics to determine factors limiting beetle colonisation, and also considered how food-web structure changed during restoration. For sites where seed addition of host-plants occurred the success in replicating beetle assemblages increased over time following a negative exponential function. Extrapolation beyond the existing data set tentatively suggested that success would plateau after 20 years, representing a c. 60% increase in assemblage similarity to target grasslands. In the absence of seed addition, similarity to the target grasslands showed no increase over time. Where seed addition was used the connectance of plant-herbivore food webs decreased over time, approaching values typical of species rich grasslands after c. 7 years. This trend was, however, dependent on the inclusion of a single site containing data in excess of 6 years of restoration management. Beetles not capable of flight, those showing high degrees of host-plant specialisation and species feeding on nationally rare host plants take between 1 and 3 years longer to colonise. Successful grassland restoration is underpinned by the establishment of host-plants, although individual species traits compound the effects of poor host-plant establishment to slow colonisation. The use of pro-active grassland restoration to mitigate against future environmental change should account for lag periods in excess of 10 years if the value of these habitats is to be fully realised.

Today, anthropogenic impacts are causing a serious crisis for global biodiversity, with rates of extinction increasing at an unprecedented rate. Extinctions typically occur after a certain delay and understanding the mechanisms causing delays is a key challenge for both fundamental and applied perspectives. 2. Here, we make use of natural experiments, the isolation of lakes by land up-lift in Northern Scandinavia, to examine how yearly extinction rates are affected by time since isolation and a range of abiotic and biotic factors. 3. In this aim, we adapted a model of delayed species loss within isolated communities to test the effects of time since isolation, area, pH, depth and presence/absence of piscivores on extinction rates. 4. As expected, we found that small and/or young lakes experience a higher annual rate of extinctions per species than larger and/or older ones. Compared to previous studies that were conducted for either young (few thousand years ago) or very old (>10 000 years ago) isolates, we demonstrated over a large and continuous temporal scales (50-5000 yr), similar relationship between extinction rates and age. We also show that extinction rates are modified by local environmental factors such as a strong negative effect of increasing pH. 5. Our results urge for the need to consider the time since critical environmental changes occurred when studying extinction rates. In a wider perspective our study demonstrates the need to consider extinction debts when modeling future effects of climate change, land-use changes, or biological invasions on biodiversity.

Remaining fragments are small, isolated, and embedded within a range of human land-use types. In this study, we ask: how should we invest conservation resources if we want to restore this landscape and prevent predicted extinctions? To answer this question, we use path analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects of forest area, forest connectivity, and matrix land-use types on species richness within five bird feeding guilds. We found that forest connectivity had a significant direct effect on insectivoresfragments that were more connected had more species of insectivores than those that were isolated. Moreover, forest area had a significant indirect effect on insectivores that was mediated through tree species richness. Larger fragments had more species of trees, which led to more species of insectivores. Fragment area, connectivity, matrix land-use type, and tree species richness had no significant effects on the species richness of frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, or generalist feeders. To conserve insectivores in coastal forests, conservation efforts should focus on maximizing fragment connectivity across the landscape, but also protect the tree community within fragments from degradation. This can be achieved by including matrix habitats that adjoin forest fragments within forest conservation and restoration plans. Natural matrix habitats can increase connectivity, provide supplementary resources, buffer fragments from degradation, and could play an important role in safeguarding diversity and preventing extinctions in this threatened human-modified landscape.

Predicting where extirpations are likely to occur and implementing management actions before losses result may be more cost-effective than trying to reestablish lost populations. Early indicators of pressure on populations could be used to make such predictions. Previous work conducted in 2009 and 2010 identified that the presence of Eastern Yellow Robins (Eopsaltria australis) in 42 sites in a fragmented region of eastern Australia was unrelated to woodland extent within 500 m of a site, but the robins' heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios (an indicator of chronic stress) were elevated at sites with low levels of surrounding woodland. We resurveyed these 42 sites in 2013 and 2014 for robin presence to determine whether the H:L ratios obtained in 2009 and 2010 predicted the locations of extirpations and whether the previous pattern in H:L ratios was an early sign that woodland extent would become an important predictor of occupancy. We also surveyed for robins at 43 additional sites to determine whether current occupancy could be better predicted by landscape context at a larger scale, relevant to dispersal movements. At the original 42 sites, H:L ratios and extirpations were not related, although only 4 extirpations were observed. Woodland extent within 500 m had become a strong predictor of occupancy. Taken together, these results provide mixed evidence as to whether patterns of individual condition can reveal habitat relationships that become evident as local shifts in occupancy occur but that are not revealed by a single snapshot of species distribution. Across all 85 sites, woodland extent at scales relevant to dispersal (5 km) was not related to occurrence. We recommend that conservation actions focus on regenerating areas of habitat large enough to support robin territories rather than increasing connectivity within the landscape.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 OCT","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","31","5","1141","1151","10.1111/cobi.12903","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000409319400017","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cosgrove, Anita J. et al.

Arthropods were sampled in four 150 m long transects in each habitat type. Arthropods were identified to species level and classified as Azorean endemic, single-island endemic (SIE), native, or introduced. The native forest had the highest values for species richness of Azorean endemics, SIEs and natives; and also had highest values of Azorean endemic diversity (Fisher's alpha). In contrast, the intensive pasture had the lowest values for endemic and native species richness and diversity, but the highest values of total arthropod abundance and introduced species richness and diversity. Arthropod community composition was significantly different between the four habitat types. In the semi-natural pasture, the number of SIE species decreased with increasing distance from the native forest, and in the exotic forest the abundance of both Azorean endemics and SIEs decreased with increasing distance from the native forest. There is a gradient of decreasing arthropod richness and abundance from the native forest to the intensive pasture. Although this study demonstrates the important role of the native forest in arthropod conservation in the Azores, it also shows that unmanaged exotic forests have provided alternative habitat suitable for some native species of forest specialist arthropods, particularly saproxylic beetles.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER","2011 AUG","JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION","15","4","505","522","10.1007/s10841-010-9330-2","1366-638X and 1572-9753","WOS:000294460300002","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Meijer, Seline S. et al.

Here we report a study testing the effect of forest fragmentation on the dynamics of the dwarf bamboo Sasa chartacea and on forest herb communities in the Tokachi plain of Hokkaido, Japan. We studied 16 forest fragments of different sizes and small plots established in these fragments to examine the relationship between the abundance of S. chartacea, landscape and environmental conditions, and forest herb communities. Sasa chartacea was more abundant near forest edges and in smaller fragments, suggesting that the species has expanded its local range and increased its abundance in response to forest fragmentation. Edge-related changes in light and soil moisture might have facilitated this range expansion. The species richness of forest herbs was strongly negatively related to the density of S. chartacea. Because much larger variation in species richness was explained by S. chartacea density than distance to the nearest forest edge, the expansion of S. chartacea has likely excluded other understory species by competition. In addition, the density of S. chartacea significantly explained variation in the species composition of forest herbs across plots.

Species diversity was greatest in the HCV forests (H' = 2.22), followed by oil palm plantation (H' = 1.11), and then edge (H' = 1.07). The smaller HCV forest (116 ha vs. 990 ha) contained more species than the larger forest (25 vs. 17 species).

Remnant forests are critical for biodiversity conservation and can help in understanding how does forest fragmentation affect tree communities.Objective Determine the effect of habitat configuration and availability on tree communities.Methods We mapped forest in a 60 km 2 landscape and sampled 93 tree communities in 52 forest fragments following stratified random sampling. At each sampling point, we inventoried all trees with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm within a radius of 10 m. We then analysed the response of the composition, the structure and the richness of tree communities to the fragment size and isolation, distance from the edge, as well as the topographical position.Results Our results showed that the distance from the forest edge was the variable that explained the greatest observed variance in tree assemblages. We observed a decrease in the abundance and richness of animaldispersed trees as well as a decrease in the abundance of large trees with increasing proximity to forest edges. Near forest edgeswe found a shift in species composition with a dominance of stress-tolerant pioneer species.Conclusions Edge-effects are likely to be the main processes that affect remnant forest tree communities after about a century of forest fragmentation.

The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of habitat fragmentation and abiotic conditions on the survival and changes in population size of four endangered, long-lived river corridor plant species (Euphorbia palustris, Pseudolysimachion longifolium, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Senecio paludosus) over the course of at least ten years. We sampled altogether 138 populations in the Weser and Elbe river systems in North-western Germany.Overall, 33% of the populations went extinct during the study period. Extinction rates and changes in population size were related to initial population sizes, but not to population isolation and only marginally so to habitat quality. Large populations (> 100 individuals) had a much higher probability to survive or increase in size (to > 1000 individuals) than smaller populations. There was no general decline in population size in surviving populations, and extinction rates and changes in population size were independent of time. We therefore conclude that the high extinction rates in small populations are best explained by sudden short-term environmental events, such as changes in land use, rather than by long-term negative effects of, for example, genetic deterioration. A projection matrix for the next 117 years, however, predicted that 85% of the surveyed populations will have gone extinct. Since any establishment of new populations in the study area is unlikely owing to the lack of potential habitats and dispersal limitation, river corridor plants will probably continue to decline. Apart from preventing further habitat deterioration it will be crucial to maintain or establish an appropriate management, and to avoid sudden and adverse changes in land use.",NA,NA,"2014","FLORISTISCH-SOZIOLOGISCHEN ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT E V","2014","TUEXENIA",NA,"34","233","245",NA,"0722-494X","WOS:000341545700013","WILHELM-WEBER-STRASSE 2, GOETTINGEN, 00000, GERMANY","Article","GOETTINGEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Waerner, Christina et al.

We searched and surveyed for the giant armadillo within human-modified areas in central Brazil using direct and indirect methods across a wide region dominated by diverse farming environments and scattered remnants of natural vegetation. During a 14-year period (2003-2016), we located 54 records of the species, including three road-kills and two instances of poaching. Most of the occurrence points (83%) were in native vegetation, with 17% in anthropogenic environments (pastures and roads). We confirmed the presence of the giant armadillo within a wide, intensely human-altered region. These findings indicate that Cerrado and Atlantic Forest remnants in modified landscapes in central Brazil play an important role as refuges for this armadillo species. In addition to habitat loss, road-kills and poaching persist as threats to the giant armadillo.

"JOUR",NA,"Bellard, Celine and Bernery, Camille and Leclerc, Camille","Looming extinctions due to invasive species: Irreversible loss of ecological strategy and evolutionary history","Biological invasions are one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide. However, many associated extinctions are yet to occur, meaning that the ecological debt caused by invasive species could be considerable for biodiversity. We explore extinction scenarios due to invasive species and investigate whether paying off the current extinction debt will shift the global composition of mammals and birds in terms of ecological strategy and evolutionary history. Current studies mostly focus on the number of species potentially at risk due to invasions without taking into account species characteristics in terms of ecological or phylogenetic properties. We found that 11% of phylogenetic diversity worldwide is represented by invasive-threatened species. Furthermore, 14% of worldwide trait diversity is hosted by invasive-threatened mammals and 40% by invasive-threatened birds, with Neotropical and Oceanian realms being primary risk hotspots. Projected extinctions of invasive-threatened species result in a smaller reduction in ecological strategy space and evolutionary history than expected under randomized extinction scenarios. This can be explained by the strong pattern in the clustering of ecological profiles and families impacted by invasive alien species (IAS). However, our results confirm that IAS are likely to cause the selective loss of species with unique evolutionary and ecological profiles. Our results also suggest a global shift in species composition away from those with large body mass, which mostly feed in the lower foraging strata and have an herbivorous diet (mammals).

"JOUR",NA,"Kobiv, Yuriy","Response of rare alpine plant species to climate change in the Ukrainian Carpathians","Cold-adapted plant species in mountainous areas all over Europe are affected by contemporary climatic changes. This study presents a comparison of past and present distribution of rare alpine species in the high-mountain zone of the Ukrainian Carpathians, as well as trends in their monitored populations. Cold-adapted species proved to be the most vulnerable at the lower limit of their distribution, which has been undergoing an upward shift. Declines or extinctions have been noted in species typical of snowbed (Cerastium cerastoides, Salix herbacea, Saxifraga carpatica, Veronica alpina), glareophytic (Cardaminopsis neglecta, Oxyria digyna, Saxifraga oppositifolia), saxicolous (Erigeron atticus, Lloydia serotina, Veronica bellidioides) and hygrophytic habitats (Pedicularis oederi, Saxifraga aizoides). On the other hand, there are examples of positive responses of other species (Gentiana punctata, Loiseleuria procumbens) resulting from the decrease of snow cover and consequent frost damage to vegetation, which reduce competition and/or create microsites suitable for seed recruitment. Restricted to atypically low elevations, outlying populations of many declining alpine species are geographically peripheral in the Ukrainian Carpathians, and their extinction causes contraction of the species' geographical ranges and significant irreversible loss of biodiversity in the region. The current decline of cold-adapted species results not only from warming during the most recent period, but is also triggered by an extinction debt accumulated in the past.",NA,NA,"2017","SPRINGER","2017 JUN","FOLIA GEOBOTANICA","52","2","217","226","10.1007/s12224-016-9270-z","1211-9520 and 1874-9348","WOS:000410776600006","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kobiv, Yuriy (2017) Response of Rare Alpine Plant Species to Climate Change in the Ukrainian Carpathians. <i>Jour</i>.

The mighty rivers that drain the Himalaya - the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Mekong and Yangtze - are amongst the world's most biodiverse freshwater ecosystems. Many hundreds of dams have been constructed, are under construction, or are planned on these rivers and large hydrological changes and losses of biodiversity have occurred and are expected to continue. This study examines the causes of range decline of the Indus dolphin, which inhabits one of the world's most modified rivers, to demonstrate how we may expect other vertebrate populations to respond as planned dams and water developments come into operation. The historical range of the Indus dolphin has been fragmented into 17 river sections by diversion dams; dolphin sighting and interview surveys show that river dolphins have been extirpated from ten river sections, they persist in 6, and are of unknown status in one section. Seven potential factors influencing the temporal and spatial pattern of decline were considered in three regression model sets. Low dry-season river discharge, due to water abstraction at irrigation barrages, was the principal factor that explained the dolphin's range decline, influencing 1) the spatial pattern of persistence, 2) the temporal pattern of subpopulation extirpation, and 3) the speed of extirpation after habitat fragmentation. Dolphins were more likely to persist in the core of the former range because water diversions are concentrated near the range periphery. Habitat fragmentation and degradation of the habitat were inextricably intertwined and in combination caused the catastrophic decline of the Indus dolphin.",NA,NA,"2014","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2014 JUL 16","PLOS ONE","9","7",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0101657.s001","1932-6203","DRCI:DATA2015149007152035","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Data study","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Braulik, Gill T. et al.

Owing to the importance of both mowing and grazing Ellenberg indicator values were not used in the identification process.Results: The final regional species pool consisted of 227 species, of which 194 were extracted from the flora, while 33 agricultural landscape species were added from the actual pool or from a list of species in additional hay meadows. Some of the 33 species were regular inhabitants of hay meadows, others were rare in the region. The regional species pool list includes information on each species on demands when hydrology, nutrients and base saturation in the soil is concerned, and whether or not they are characteristic for either of the boreal or boreo-nemoral vegetation zones.Conclusions: Specialist knowledge was an advantage when adding cultural landscape species other than meadow species of the flora; 77 species were documented only by the flora, interesting from the point of view of restoration as this part of the pool would not have been found by just adding species lists.

The current patterns, processes and consequences of invasion have been intensively studied globally, but studies reporting the long-term dynamics of invasions over large areas are rare. Here, we measured how the temporal changes in fish assemblage composition in a Chinese highland isolated-lake landscape drive taxonomic dissimilarity and its turnover component over three successive time periods spanning the last 75 years.Location Yun-Gui Plateau, 15 isolated lakes.Methods The Sorensen and Simpson indices were used to quantify changes in taxonomic dissimilarity and its turnover component over 1940-2015.Results We report a decline of taxonomic dissimilarity between lakes through time, mainly due to a decrease in species turnover. Such a homogenization process was due to the combined effects of the invasion of the same non-native species in most lakes and of extirpation of narrow endemic species. The strong decline in species dissimilarity and turnover was triggered by a high historical level of dissimilarity among assemblages. At a regional scale, the combined effect of introductions and extirpations modified the distance decay of taxonomic similarity between lakes. Surprisingly, this beta-diversity gradient is currently no longer supported by biogeographic and evolutionary processes, but by the human-mediated introduction of distinct exotic species in some lakes. Moreover, an extinction debt process was evident as extirpations sometimes occurred many years after the introduction of non-native species.Main conclusions Our study highlights that high historical differentiation of fishes in isolated lakes has turned to homogenization with dramatic loss of endemic species due to intensive introductions. This provides a striking example of human domination over an extended lake landscape and its associated irreparable biodiversity damages on isolated systems historically dominated by narrow endemic species.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 FEB","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","23","2","171","184","10.1111/ddi.12507","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000391933400005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ding, Chengzhi et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Ewers, RM and Didham, RK","Confounding factors in the detection of species responses to habitat fragmentation","Habitat loss has pervasive and disruptive impacts on biodiversity in habitat remnants. The magnitude of the ecological impacts of habitat loss can be exacerbated by the spatial arrangement - or fragmentation - of remaining habitat. Fragmentation per se is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modified environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries. The implications of this for individual organisms are many and varied, because species with differing life history strategies are differentially affects by habitat fragmentation. Here, we review the extensive literature on species responses to habitat fragmentation, and detail the numerous ways in which confounding factors have either masked the detection, or prevented the manifestation, of predicted fragmentation effects.Large numbers of empirical studies continue to document changes in species richness with decreasing habitat area, wit positive, negative and no relationships regularly reported. The debate surrounding such widely contrasting results is beginning to be resolved by findings that the expected positive species-area relationship can be masked by matrix-derived spatial subsides of resources to fragment-swelling species and by invasion of matrix-dwelling species into habitat edges. Significant advances have been made recently in our understanding of how species interactions are altered at habitat edges as a result of these changes. Interestingly, changes in biotic and abiotic parameters at edges also make ecological processes more variable than in habitat interiors. Individuals are more likely to encounter habitat edges in fragments wit convoluted shapes, leading to increased turnover and variability in population size that in fragments that are compact in shape. Habitat isolation in both space and time disrupts species distribution patterns, with consequent effects on metapopulation dynamics and the genetic structure of fragment-dwelling populations. Again, the matrix habitat is a strong determinant of fragmentation effects within remnants because of its role in regulating dispersal and dispersal-related mortality, the provision of spatial subsides and the potential mediation of edge-related microclimatic gradients.We show that confounding factors can mask many fragmentation effects. For instance, there are multiple ways in which species traits like trophic level, dispersal ability and degree of habitat specialisation influence species-level responses. The temporal scale of investigation may have a Strong influence Oil the results Ora study, with short-term crowding effects eventually giving way to long-term extinction debts. Moreover. many fragmentation effects like changes in genetic, morphological or behavioural traits Of Species require time to appear. By contrast, synergistic interactions of fragmentation with climate change, human-altered disturbance regimes, species interactions and other drivers of population decline may magnify the impacts of fragmentation. To conclude, we emphasise that anthropogenic fragmentation is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary time and suggest that the final, long-term impacts of habitat fragmentation may not yet have shown themselves.",NA,NA,"2006","WILEY","2006 FEB","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS","81","1","117","142","10.1017/S1464793105006949","1464-7931 and 1469-185X","WOS:000236101600005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ewers, RM et al.

However, the suitability of novel restoration concepts such as trophic rewilding is still under discussion given fragmentary empirical data and limited theory development. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the concept of 'ecological memory' into trophic rewilding. The ecological memory of an ecosystem is defined as an ecosystem's accumulated abiotic and biotic material and information legacies from past dynamics. By summarising existing knowledge about the ecological effects of megafauna extinction and rewilding across a large range of spatial and temporal scales, we identify two key drivers of ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding: (i) impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna, and (ii) ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem. The impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna species can be estimated from species properties such as lifetime per capita engineering capacity, population density, home range size and niche overlap with resident species. The importance of ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem depends on (i) the absolute time since megafauna loss, (ii) the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover, (iii) the strength of species interactions characterising the focal ecosystem, and (iv) the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems. These properties related to the focal and surrounding ecosystems mediate material and information legacies (its ecological memory) and modulate the net ecosystem impact of (re)introduced megafauna species. We provide practical advice about how to quantify all these properties while highlighting the strong link between ecological memory and historically contingent ecosystem trajectories. With this newly established ecological memory-rewilding framework, we hope to guide future empirical studies that investigate the ecological effects of trophic rewilding and other ecosystem-restoration approaches. The proposed integrated conceptual framework should also assist managers and decision makers to anticipate the possible trajectories of ecosystem dynamics after restoration actions and to weigh plausible alternatives. This will help practitioners to develop adaptive management strategies for trophic rewilding that could facilitate sustainable management of functioning ecosystems in an increasingly human-dominated world.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 FEB","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS","94","1","1","15","10.1111/brv.12432","1464-7931 and 1469-185X","WOS:000456071400001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Schweiger, Andreas H. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Zahawi, Rakan A. and Duran, Guillermo and Kormann, Urs","Sixty-Seven Years of Land-Use Change in Southern Costa Rica","Habitat loss and fragmentation of forests are among the biggest threats to biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. We use the vicinity of the Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica as a regional case study to document seven decades of land-use change in one of the most intensively studied sites in the Neotropics. Though the premontane wet forest was largely intact in 1947, a wave of immigration in 1952 initiated rapid changes over a short period. Overall forest cover was reduced during each time interval analyzed (1947-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-1997, 1997-2014), although the vast majority of forest loss (> 90%) occurred during the first two time intervals (1947-1960, 1960-1980) with an annual deforestation rate of 2.14% and 3.86%, respectively. The rate dropped to < 2% thereafter and has been offset by forest recovery in fallow areas more recently, but overall forest cover has continued to decline. Approximately 27.9% of the study area is forested currently. Concomitantly, the region shifted from a single contiguous forest to a series of progressively smaller forest fragments with each successive survey. A strong reduction in the amount of core habitat was paralleled by an increased proportion of edge habitat, due to the irregular shape of many forest fragments. Structural connectivity, however, remains high, with an expansive network of > 100 km of linear strips of vegetation within a 3 km radius of the station, which may facilitate landscape-level movement for some species. Despite the extent of forest loss, a substantial number of regional landscape-level studies over the past two decades have demonstrated the persistence of many groups of organisms such as birds and mammals. Nonetheless, the continued decline in the quantity and quality of remaining habitat (similar to 30% of remaining forest is secondary), as well as the threat of an extinction debt (or time lag in species loss), may result in the extirpation of additional species if more proactive conservation measures are not taken to reverse current trends-a pattern that reflects many other tropical regions the world over.",NA,NA,"2015","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2015 NOV 23","PLOS ONE","10","11",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0143554","1932-6203","WOS:000365853900144","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Article","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Zahawi, Rakan A. et al.

The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in 2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 %), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R-2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R-2 = 0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U$ 15.1 million (U$ 419 k/year).

Research has focused on the effect of patch size on biodiversity, while neglecting patch quality effects and leaving geographic and interspecific variance to patch attributes largely unexamined. Here, we asses show patch size and quality affect the encounter rate (ER) and immature-to-female ratio (IFR) of three endangered primates - Mexican mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), and spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) - in three rainforest regions with different forest cover. ER of spider monkeys in the best preserved region (50% forest cover) was positively related to both patch size and quality (i.e., species richness of top food species). ER of mantled howlers in the 17% forest cover region was also positively related to patch size. Yet, both ER and IFR of black howlers in the 50% forest cover region and mantled howlers in the 5% forest cover region were mainly related to patch quality. Our results demonstrate that conservation actions in human-modified landscapes must go beyond considering the effect of patch size, as animal populations can be better predicted by patch quality in some regions.

The first step in addressing the challenge of how to reverse the negative outlook for the coming years starts with measuring environmental loss rates and assigning responsibilities. Pinpointing the global pressures on biodiversity is a task best addressed using holistic models such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is the leading method for calculating cradle-to-grave environmental impacts of products and services; it is actively promoted by many public policies, and integrated as part of environmental information systems within private companies. LCA already deals with the potential biodiversity impacts of land use, but there are significant obstacles to overcome before its models grasp the full reach of the phenomena involved. In this review, we discuss some pressing issues that need to be addressed. LCA mainly introduces biodiversity as an endpoint category modeled as a loss in species richness due to the conversion and use of land over time and space. The functional and population effects on biodiversity are mostly absent due to the emphasis on species accumulation with limited geographic and taxonomical reach. Current land-use modeling activities that use biodiversity indicators tend to oversimplify the real dynamics and complexity of the interactions of species among each other and with their habitats. To identify the main areas for improvement, we systematically reviewed LCA studies on land use that had findings related to global change and conservation ecology. We provide suggestion as to how to address some of the issues raised. Our overall objective was to encourage companies to monitor and take concrete steps to address the impacts of land use on biodiversity on a broader geographical scale and along increasingly globalized supply chains.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 JAN","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","21","1","32","47","10.1111/gcb.12709","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000346698100007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Souza, Danielle M. et al.

We provide a method for using habitat mapping data and herbarium records to identify plant species that are threatened by the rapid conversion of brigalow forest, a widespread habitat type in eastern Australia that has been decimated over the last 60 years. The method weights species depending on the strength of their association with the brigalow forest habitat and their association with the Brigalow Belt region where the clearance of native vegetation has been extensive. The process identifies 56 out of a total of 1229 plant species that are at greatest potential risk. Twenty of the 56 species also occur in habitats that have not been extensively cleared. Of the remaining 36 species, 11 are closely associated with brigalow forest, which in general has been more extensively cleared than other habitats. The method revealed several species potentially imperilled by habitat loss that have not previously been identified by formal listing of threatened species. The rate of habitat loss for the target species can be clearly documented, although further survey is required to determine the potential persistence of species in habitat that has been modified by clearing and an estimate of generation length of the plant species is required in order to assess this decline against IUCN threat categories.

In order to maintain a flora rich in such species, design of management practices based upon knowledge of life-history consequences following management shifts is essential. In this study, we investigated the demography of the perennial grassland species Plantago lanceolata for 4 years in one mulched site and two abandoned sites to compare how the two treatments influenced population dynamics. Compared to abandonment, mulching had a small but positive effect on the population growth rate (lambda) of P. lanceolata. In both the mulched and the abandoned sites, growth and stasis among the largest plants contributed most strongly to lambda, while the contribution of fecundity was negligible in both treatments. lambda of P. lanceolata varied more between years than between treatments, most notably because lambda values below unity were observed in the abandoned sites in a 1-year period that included a severe winter. The population of the mulched site consisted of larger ramets and had higher clonal growth rates than the populations of the abandoned sites.

"JOUR",NA,"Kopecky, Martin and Hedl, Radim and Szabo, Peter","Non-random extinctions dominate plant community changes in abandoned coppices","The plant community structure of European lowland forests has changed dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to biodiversity decline at various spatial scales. However, due to methodological difficulties associated with simultaneous changes in species diversity and composition, ecological processes behind the changes are still poorly understood. We analysed temporal changes in forest plant community after the mid-twentieth-century abandonment of coppicing in a typical Central European forest, which had been managed as coppice for centuries. We used 122 semi-permanent plots first surveyed in the 1950s shortly after the last coppicing and again in the 2000s after half a century of natural succession. We used a novel temporal nestedness analysis to disentangle the immigration and extinction processes underlying temporal changes in community structure and tested whether species gains and losses were ecologically random. The studied vegetation has shifted from the species-rich assemblages of a relatively open and low-nutrient forest towards the impoverished flora of a closed-canopy forest dominated by a few shade-adapted species. The significant reduction in beta diversity, that is, compositional heterogeneity among plots, indicated taxonomic homogenization of the forest understorey. Temporal species turnover was only a minor component of the community change, and recent assemblages are nested subsets of the former ones. Ecologically non-random extinctions dominated these changes. Light-demanding species with a persistent seed bank were the most prone to extinction, while species with high specific leaf area substantially increased in frequency. Synthesis and applications. The dominant process after the abandonment of coppicing was the ecologically non-random extinction of light-demanding species, leading to an impoverished, temporally nested plant community structure. This development is typical for many abandoned coppices and poses a significant threat to forest biodiversity in Europe. If forestry and conservation policies continue to prefer closed-canopy stands, many endangered species are likely to pay their extinction debts. To restore declining or even locally extinct species, canopy opening in abandoned coppices is urgently needed.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 FEB","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","50","1","79","87","10.1111/1365-2664.12010","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000314520500010","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kopecky, Martin et al.

Analyses are based on a total of 1,702 zooxanthellate coral specimens collected from six coral-bearing units ranging in age from the earliest Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene: (1) Valiente Formation (12-11 Ma), (2) Fish Hole Member of the Old Bank Formation (5.8-5.6 Ma), (3) La Gruta Member of the Isla Colon Formation (2.2-1.4 Ma), (4) Ground Creek Member of the Isla Colon Formation (2.2-1.4 Ma), (5) Mimitimbi Member of the Urraca Formation (1.2-0.8 Ma), and (6) Hill Point Member of the Urraca Formation (1.2-0.8 Ma). Over 100 coral species occur in the six units, with faunal assemblages ranging from less than 10% extant taxa (Valiente Formation) to over 85% extant taxa (Ground Creek Member). The collections provide new temporal constraints on the emergence of modern Caribbean reefs, with the La Gruta Member containing the earliest occurrence of large monospecific stands of the dominant Caribbean reef coral Acropora palmata, and the Urraca Formation containing the last fossil occurrences of 15 regionally extinct taxa. Canonical correspondence analysis of 41 Late Miocene to Recent reef coral assemblages from the Caribbean region suggests changes in community structure coincident with effective oceanic closure of the Central American Seaway (similar to 3.5 Ma).

We studied sacred groves in Epirus, NW Greece, where a large number of such SNS have been identified. Based on historical, ethnographic and ecological criteria, we selected eight of these groves and matching control sites and in them we studied fungi, lichens, herbaceous plants, woody plants, nematodes, insects, bats and passerine birds. Our results reveal that the contribution of SNS to species conservation is nuanced by taxon, vegetation type and management history. We found that the sacred groves have a small conservation advantage over the corresponding control sites. More specifically, there are more distinct sets of organisms amongst sacred groves than amongst control sites, and overall biodiversity, diversity per taxonomic group, and numbers of species from the European SCI list (Species of Community Interest) are all marginally higher in them. Conservationists regard the often small size of SNS as a factor limiting their conservation value. The sizes of SNS around the globe vary greatly, from a few square meters to millions of hectares. Given that those surveyed by us (ranging from 5 to 116 ha) are at the lower end of this spectrum, the small conservation advantage that we testified becomes important.

Data from the non-protected areas (non-PAs) surrounding the nature reserve network served as a baseline for comparison. We found that some indexes of ecological restoration in the nature reserve network were superior to those in the non-PAs, such as average annual vegetation coverage and net primary production. After the establishment of the nature reserve network, ecosystem water retention service increased by 72% compared to those in the non-PAs. In the non-PAs, intensified or new degradation occurred due to overgrazing and over-exploitation. In recent years, the wetting and warming climate has been the main driver of ecological restoration in the region. The establishment of the nature reserve networks and the implementation of conservation projects both promote the improvement of local ecosystems.

We hypothesized that bat activity at a wind farm would be explained, at least in part, by attraction and avoidance behaviours caused by deforestation. We tested predictions of this hypothesis via a landscape-level acoustic, capture, and radiotelemetry survey of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)) and northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis (Trouessart, 1897)). Acoustic and capture data indicated no significant difference in magnitude of activity between the fragmented wind farm and the less-fragmented surrounding areas. However, only 2 of 19 radio-tracked bats were ever located inside the wind farm despite being captured adjacent to it. Bat locations were compared against randomly generated locations within the same area in a logistic regression framework to rank landscape variables in order of association with bats. A multicriteria evaluation of forest metrics showed that, over a 3-year period, there was an increase of suitable habitat inside the wind farm for M. lucifugus and a decrease for M. septentrionalis. These results support the contention that, at this level of disturbance, M. lucifugus may use the cleared areas, while M. septentrionalis is negatively impacted by increased deforestation caused by wind-farm development.",NA,NA,"2014","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","2014 AUG","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY","92","8","665","673","10.1139/cjz-2014-0040","0008-4301 and 1480-3283","WOS:000344954800002","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","Article","OTTAWA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Segers, J.

Here we studied forest margins heavily used by local fanners in a forest/agriculture mosaic landscape in Ethiopia. We compared forest structure and plant species composition across 41 forest-agriculture ecotones from 200 m out into the agricultural area to 200 m into the forest. There are strong edge effects from the edge and into the forest on canopy cover and number of stumps and apparently these forest-agricultural edges are intensively used by humans. They are penetrated by paths, beehives are found in the trees, timber of various dimensions is harvested and there is sometimes substantial cover of perennial wild (or semi-wild) crops such as coffee and spices. The number of understory epiphytic fern species as well as number of epiphyllous (i.e., growing on leaves) bryophyte species was lower at 20 m than at 75 m from the edge. The number of fern species was higher in newly created edges and thereafter they declined, which indicates an extinction debt. This pattern was not seen for the epiphyllous bryophytes. It is likely that different human management activities are responsible for many of the found edge effects besides wind and sun effects from the edge. Tropical forest margins provide important resources for people in many landscapes. It is important to understand how such use affects the biota of the forests.

Here, we examined the trends and reproduction of the red kite Milvus milvus, a highly endangered raptor near-endemic to Europe, to illustrate the dual benefits and challenges faced by a national park to protect this iconic species. Over the past 4 decades, the kite population of southern Spain has declined steeply and has become progressively confined to Donana National Park and its buffering Natural Park areas. Population deterioration was also evident within the protected area through (1) spikes of rapid eradication of whole sub-populations from buffer areas, likely propelled by illegal poisoning, and (2) more gradual but steady deterioration of numbers and reproduction, especially in peripheral buffer areas, probably caused by the interplay of several shocks related to food availability, habitat degradation, competition, predation, and chemical contamination. The result was a 46-55% decline with progressive confinement to the core National Park and an alarming effective population size of <10 pairs. Demographic modelling suggested low adult survival and predicted further declines, with possible extinction over the next 2 decades. We outline tentative goals for management, but these will need urgent information on ranging and mortality to provide more efficient targets. These results illustrate how establishment of a large park can prevent regional extinction, but not necessarily guarantee species-safety, leading to protracted forms of extinction debt.

Key knowledge gaps are related to the potential for evolutionary rescue in response to climate, especially in long-lived clonally reproducing species. We illustrate a novel approach to assess the potential for evolutionary rescue using a combination of reciprocal transplant experiment in the field to assess performance under a changing climate and independent growth chamber assays to assess growth- and physiology-related plant trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones. We use a clonal grass, Festuca rubra, as a model species. We propagated individual clones and used them in a transplant experiment across broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients, simulating the projected direction of climate change in the region. Independent information on trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones was obtained by cultivating them in four growth chambers representing climate extremes. Plant survival was affected by interaction between plant traits and climate change, with both trait plasticities and maxima being important for adaptation to novel climates. Key traits include plasticity in extravaginal ramets, aboveground biomass, and osmotic potential. The direction of selection in response to a given climatic change detected in this study mostly contradicted the natural trait clines indicating that short-term selection pressure as identified here does not match long-term selection outcomes. Long-lived clonal species exposed to different climatic changes are subjected to consistent selection pressures on key traits, a necessary condition for adaptation to novel conditions. This points to evolutionary rescue as an important mechanism for dealing with climate change in these species. Our experimental approach may be applied also in other model systems broadening our understanding of evolutionary rescue. Such knowledge cannot be easily deduced from observing the existing field clines.",NA,NA,"2021","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","2021 MAY 17","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","12",NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2021.659479","1664-462X","WOS:000656258200001","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Article","LAUSANNE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Munzbergova, Zuzana et al.

Since the 1960s, the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) has undergone extensive declines in heavily urbanized southern California, where the range edge has rapidly contracted northward while shifting its cardinal orientation to an east-west trending axis. We studied the genetic structure and diversity of these frontline populations, tested for signatures of contemporary disturbance, specifically fire, and attempted to disentangle these signals from demographic events extending deeper into the past. Consistent with the genetic expectations of the abundant-center model, we found that diversity, admixture, and opportunity for random mating increases in populations sampled successively further away from the range boundary. Demographic simulations indicate that bottlenecks in peripheral isolates are associated with processes extending tens to a few hundred generations in the past, despite the demographic collapse of some due to recent fire-flood events. While the effects of recent disturbance have left little genetic imprint on these populations, they likely contribute to an extinction debt that will lead to continued range contraction unless management intervenes to stall or reverse the process.

We selected Fudoji and Kiryu watersheds in Shiga for runoff generation and Tanzawa in Kanagawa and Saru watersheds in Hokkaido for sediment transport. Regarding runoff generation, variation of concentration of specific chemical species (i.e. silica) suggested various flow paths from weathered bedrock layer to soil layer in small catchments, although variation tapered with increased catchment area because of the mixing of several flow components. Sediment transport also varied spatially depending on the catchment characteristics. Variation tapered with increased catchment area. Moreover, increased storage components and decreased ratios of sediment source areas to the total catchment area for larger drainage areas decreased the sediment transport with catchment areas in some catchments.

A fifteen-year reappraisal of bryophyte metacommunities in a fragmented landscape","Forest fragmentation impacts community structure at both local and regional scales over time. Understanding the resilience of tropical forests to anthropogenic impacts and the period for communities to recover are critics steps for conservation policy implementation. We took advantage of a dynamic group of land plants to stud: temporal changes in their community structure over a period of 15 years at a landscape-scale experiments fragmentation site in central Amazonia. We observed an overall increase in estimated epiphyll abundances and species richness in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha reserves) suggesting recovery rather than a belated accumulation of local extinction events. However, higher turnover in smaller fragments, when compared to large ones, was driven by increased presence of core species indicating interspecific differences in survivability. These disproportionate changes in occupancy patterns and relative abundances in fragments were best explained by life history traits reflecting increased dispersal capacity and physiological tolerances suggesting recovery of the phyllosphere community in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha) over 15 years. Even for this group renowned for fast generation times and high reproductive output, epiphyll metacommunities of smaller fragments have yet to recover from local extinctions accrued following the initial fragmentation nearly 40 years ago.

Here, we examine how two contemporary drivers of fragmentation, anthropogenic climate change and exurbanization, affect movement and responses of animal species to new environmental conditions. We address the definition of fragmentation and how the spatial patterns created by fragmentation can be measured at the scales at which different species of animals respond to their environments. We discuss tools, such as satellite remote sensing, that increasingly make it possible to identify and quantify changes in land cover and vegetation structure across extensive areas. We also describe a range of methods that are available to guide decisions about faunal surveys and monitoring programs in fragments or reference areas. Examination of stochastic changes in land cover and species occurrence over time is important because these shifts can confound detection of systematic responses to fragmentation.

Stumps of three different ages (4, 14 and 75 years) were sampled to see if Collembola used the dead wood during the whole rotation period of a forest. Stumps of spruce, pine and birch were compared. Both the bark and the splint wood of the stumps were sampled. To determine whether the stump also influenced the nearby soil, the soil close to the stump were sampled as well as the soil further away. In total, five Collembola species that are known to prefer dead wood as a substrate were found in the stumps. Wood specialists were more dominating in young stumps, but occurred also in the oldest stumps. No preference was found for any specific tree species. Wood-living Collembola seem to be able to survive in low stumps for a whole rotation period, at least in low numbers.

The difference made by protected areas is their impact, defined in program evaluation as the outcomes arising from protection relative to the counterfactual of no protection or a different form of protection. Although impact evaluation of programs is well established in fields such as medicine, education and development aid, it is rare in nature conservation. We show that the present weak alignment with impact of policy targets and operational objectives for protected areas involves a great risk: targets and objectives can be achieved while making little difference to the conservation of biodiversity. We also review potential ways of increasing the difference made by protected areas, finding a poor evidence base for the use of planning and management 'levers' to better achieve impact.

Historical land use may be especially important in cultural landscapes, producing legacies that influence ecosystem structure, function, and biota that in turn affect ES supply.Our goal was to generate a conceptual framework for understanding when land-use legacies matter for ES supply in well-studied agricultural, urban, and exurban US landscapes.We synthesized illustrative examples from published literature in which landscape legacies were demonstrated or are likely to influence ES.We suggest three related conditions in which land-use legacies are important for understanding current ES supply. (1) Intrinsically slow ecological processes govern ES supply, illustrated for soil-based and hydrologic services impaired by slowly processed pollutants. (2) Time lags between land-use change and ecosystem responses delay effects on ES supply, illustrated for biodiversity-based services that may experience an ES debt. (3) Threshold relationships exist, such that changes in ES are difficult to reverse, and legacy lock-in disconnects contemporary landscapes from ES supply, illustrated by hydrologic services. Mismatches between contemporary landscape patterns and mechanisms underpinning ES supply yield unexpected patterns of ES.Today's land-use decisions will generate tomorrow's legacies, and ES will be affected if processes underpinning ES are affected by land-use legacies. Research priorities include understanding effects of urban abandonment, new contaminants, and interactions of land-use legacies and climate change.

However, their long term ability to preserve plant diversity despite increasing disturbances remains to be tested. In 2013, we resurveyed 133 plots in forest stands of a Canadian suburban park first sampled in 1977. Since the initial survey, invasive species have expanded in surrounding areas, a major ice storm hit the region, and white-tailed deer have become abundant. We evaluated changes in alpha, gamma, beta and functional diversity, as well as in the forest structure and composition, using a set of univariate and multivariate analyses. We also used a species-traits indicator approach to identify drivers of changes. We found a major increase in alpha and gamma diversity, accompanied by a 30% decrease in beta diversity. These changes were associated with an increase in native plant frequency and abundance. Moreover, we found no loss in functional diversity (higher functional richness, dispersion and evenness in 2013 than in 1977). These changes likely resulted from the combination of stand maturation (more shade-tolerant species), forest regeneration following the ice storm (densification of the sapling layer), deer browsing (increased frequency and abundance of ferns, sedges and grasses, and of species with a storage organ) as well as post-disturbance recovery (alpha and gamma diversity increase). Our findings highlight the ability of suburban parks to preserve native flora, despite natural and anthropogenic disturbances as well as overall biotic homogenization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We analysed the persistence of five model species inhabiting dead wood. By parameterising a metapopulation model (the incidence function model), the model species were all assigned characteristics that makes it likely that they have disappeared from some (20%) forest landscapes with a long history of forest management. In the metapopulation model, a forest stand (5 ha) was regarded as a habitat patch. The amount of habitat in each patch was obtained from models of dead wood dynamics of Norway spruce in central Sweden. Dead wood generated by altered management over the entire landscape was found to be less efficient in reducing extinction risks in comparison to the same amount of dead wood generated by protecting reserves. Because generation of dead wood by altered management is often less expensive than setting aside reserves, it is difficult to determine which conservation measure is most cost-efficient. In a landscape subjected to forestry for the first time, it was better to preserve a few large reserves than many small ones. However, in a managed, highly fragmented forest landscape it was better to set aside many small reserves. The reason for this was that small plots with high habitat quality could be selected, while large reserves originally contained habitats both of high and low quality, and the rate of habitat quality increase was low. A strategy for biodiversity conservation in a managed forest landscape should include information about the history of the landscape, the current amount and spatial distribution of forest habitats, and the potential for rapid restoration of forest habitats, both on managed and unmanaged forest land.",NA,NA,"2006","SPRINGER","2006 JUL","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","21","5","687","698","10.1007/s10980-005-5222-3","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000240500100005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ranius, Thomas et al.

Short-term biodiversity experiments have documented positive effects of plant species richness on many ecosystem functions, and longer-term studies indicate, for some ecosystem functions, that biodiversity effects can become stronger over time. Theoretically, a biodiversity effect can strengthen over time by an increasing performance of high-diversity communities, by a decreasing performance of low-diversity communities, or a combination of both processes. Which of these two mechanisms prevail, and whether the increase in the biodiversity effect over time is a general property of many functions remains currently unclear. These questions are an important knowledge gap as a continuing decline in the performance of low-diversity communities would indicate an ecosystem-service debt resulting from delayed effects of species loss on ecosystem functioning. Conversely, an increased performance of high-diversity communities over time would indicate that the benefits of biodiversity are generally underestimated in short-term studies. Analyzing 50 ecosystem variables over 11 years in the world's largest grassland biodiversity experiment, we show that overall plant diversity effects strengthened over time. Strengthening biodiversity effects were independent of the considered compartment (above- or belowground), organizational level (ecosystem variables associated with the abiotic habitat, primary producers, or higher trophic levels such as herbivores and pollinators), and variable type (measurements of pools or rates). We found evidence that biodiversity effects strengthened because of both a progressive decrease in functioning in species-poor and a progressive increase in functioning in species-rich communities. Our findings provide evidence that negative feedback effects at low biodiversity are as important for biodiversity effects as complementarity among species at high biodiversity. Finally, our results indicate that a current loss of species will result in a future impairment of ecosystem functioning, potentially decades beyond the moment of species extinction.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 DEC","ECOSPHERE","7","12",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecs2.1619","2150-8925","WOS:000390136700016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Meyer, Sebastian T. et al.

Measuring the balance of species loss and gain in remaining fragmented landscapes throughout time entails a central research challenge. We resurveyed in 2013 plant species richness in the same plots of a previous sampling conducted in 2003 across 18 forest fragments of different sizes of the Chaco Serrano forest in Argentina. While the area of these forest remnants was kept constant, their surrounding forest cover changed over this time period. We compared plant species richness of both sampling years and calculated the proportion of species loss and gain at forest edges and interiors. As in 2003, we found a positive relationship between fragment area and plant richness in 2013 and both years showed a similar slope. However, we detected a net decrease of 24% of species' richness across all forest fragments, implying an unprecedentedly high rate and magnitude of species loss driven mainly by non-woody, short-lived species. There was a higher proportion of lost and gained species at forest edges than in forest interiors. Importantly, fragment area interacted with percent change in surrounding forest cover to explain the proportion of species lost. Small forest fragments showed a relatively constant proportion of species loss regardless of any changes in surrounding forest cover, whereas in larger fragments the proportion of species lost increased when surrounding forest cover decreased. We show that despite preserving fragment area, habitat quality and availability in the surroundings is of fundamental importance in shaping extinction and immigration dynamics of plant species at any given forest remnant.

Remote sensing is an especially important component of such studies when spatial and temporal capabilities are important considerations. In many cases, satellite remote sensing is not adequate because of resolution or length of observation drawbacks. However, aerial photography, which extends back into the mid 1930s, is often overlooked. In order to find relevant imagery, considerable effort needs to be expended because the aerial photos over a particular study area can be scattered in a large number of archives across the country. Once the photos are assembled, digital scanning, proper documentation, storage, and a searchable data base are necessary to make easy and effective use of the aerial photos.

However, a range of different processes may underlie or obscure this relationship. For woody plant species in forest fragments, as for other taxa, considering forest edges separately in the investigation of SAR is particularly relevant. The objective of our study was to evaluate edge influence on SAR in a fragmented forest landscape in south-western France. To achieve this objective, we considered SAR in two separate spatial portions of the forest fragment: the edge and the forest interior. We also considered SAR for different ecological groups of species based on their shade tolerance and their mode of dispersal, as species can respond differently to habitat reduction depending on their ecological characteristics. In 40 woodlands in an agricultural landscape, we observed the presence/absence of all woody species along parallel walking transects 20-m wide to inventory the total number of species in each woodlot. Vegetation surveys resulted in the identification of 53 woody species, with a total of 23 trees and 30 shrubs, and a number of species per woodlot ranging from 18 to 44. The species richness found in a given woodlot was significantly correlated with its area. When considering the edge and the interior parts of the woodlot separately we found a steeper increase in species richness with area for the part we considered as the edge, compared with the increase found in the interior part of the forest. Our results confirm the contribution of forest edge to forest fragment SAR. Results also underlined the importance of two additional processes that may contribute to SAR: a possible extinction debt of shade-tolerant species in forest edge zones and colonisation by light-demanding species in forest interior zones probably due to disturbances. This approach underlines the importance of taking the edge effect into account when studying the influence of patch size on species richness and the dynamic of species richness pattern.

In this study, we analysed the impacts of urbanization and agricultural legacy on plant communities of isolated wetlands (Laval, Quebec, Canada). We sampled 35 marshes and 32 swamps. We used multi-factor analysis of variance to compare taxonomic richness and functional diversity between wetland types, urbanization levels and former agricultural use. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and differences were evaluated using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersions. We also analysed the effect of exotic species on beta diversity. We found that urbanization and former agricultural use had no effect on taxonomic richness, functional diversity or beta diversity. However, exotics tended to be more abundant in urban and previously cultivated wetlands than in more natural ones. Furthermore, despite the absence of difference in beta diversity in response to present and past human disturbances when analysing the total species pool, we found that exotic species tend to favor homogenization. We also found that species composition differed in response to urbanization in marshes, while in swamps it differed according to former agricultural uses. This contrasting result was likely due to the fact that marshes are dominated by herbaceous species and swamps by woody species (short vs. long regeneration time). Our study highlights the importance of looking at different types of habitats within the same urban context and considering land use legacy to understand the response of ecosystems to urbanization, especially due to the time lag between disturbances and vegetation responses.",NA,NA,"2020","SPRINGER","2020 FEB","WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","28","1","19","34","10.1007/s11273-019-09692-1","0923-4861 and 1572-9834","WOS:000494393800001","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loiselle, Audreanne et al.

Some studies have derived habitat thresholds for deadwood (according to species, size, spatial distribution) as baselines for management recommendations. But a majority of studies have one important knowledge gap how long does it take for deadwood to decompose? To derive the residence time of deadwood, we used a 40-year time series of 4 censuses in European lowland hardwood temperate forests. The deadwood residence of 2252 logs of 5 main tree species was calculated using Bayesian Survival Trajectory Analysis. Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) had the longest residence time, with the largest logs decomposing for an average of 62 years. Next was narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) with a residence time of about 42 years. Field maple (Acer campestre) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) had a similar residence time - with the largest logs averaging 37-39 years. Elm (Ulmus sp.) had the fastest decomposition of large-sized logs - estimated at 24 years. Generally, small-sized logs of all investigated species decomposed quickly. Conversely, large-sized logs of hornbeam and ash decomposed as quickly as their intermediate-sized logs. Large-sized logs of elm decayed even faster than intermediate-sized logs. An analysis of the position of field maple logs during decomposition showed that those decomposing in the air or in water decomposed slower than logs ""on the ground"", with a half-life of 40 years (compared to 28 years on the ground) and a residence time of 54 years (44 years on the ground). Our results suggest that the management of deadwood should focus on (i) leaving the largest logs, which took the longest time to reach advanced decay stages, and (ii) a diversified approach regarding the individual residence time of different tree species.

While many studies have tested the effects of landscape context on the species richness and composition of vascular plants, few have compared the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes on the same landscape. We sampled non-epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants in 184 plots to test whether three landscape context factors measured four years or four decades previously could predict bryophyte or vascular plant species richness and composition after accounting for local factors. Location:Temperate forests and oak savannahs, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Methods: We used model selection and comparisons to test the effects of surrounding road density, total amount of forest, and distance to the nearest forest edge on species richness, species richness of non-disturbance-associated species, and community composition after controlling for important local predictors including substrate availability and topography. Results: The species richness of non-disturbance-associated vascular plants was lower in plots with greater surrounding historical road density, and perennial stayer bryophyte richness declined with increasing historical road density and lower historical forest amount, suggesting a potential extinction debt. Landscape context significantly affected total species richness and community composition of vascular plants, but not bryophytes. Conclusion: While bryophytes appear to be less sensitive overall to landscape context than vascular plants, disturbance-intolerant perennial stayer bryophytes may decline in the future in response to the increased road density and loss of forest cover that has occurred over the past four decades. We sampled 184 20m x 20m releve plots on the Saanich Peninsula, a region of approximately 330 km2in 2009.In each plot, we identified all vascular plants and estimated the percent cover of each. We also identified all bryophyte species occurring on soil, rock, or decomposing wood, and estimated the percent cover of each. If a species was estimated to cover less than 1% of the plot, we entered 0.5 in the data, and if it covered much less than 1%, we entered 0.1. We did not survey epiphytic bryophytes on living trees. We also measuredthe slope and aspect of each plot, and estimated the percent cover of soil, exposed rock, and decomposing wood substrate. We then used a Geographical Information System (GIS) to measure the total amount of natural vegetated area within a 500m buffer of each plot, the total length of roads within the same distance of each plot, and the distance in metres from the plot to the nearest edge between natural and non-natural vegetation.

Riverine landscapes are heterogeneous in space (complex mosaic of habitat types) and time (expansion and contraction cycles, landscape legacies). They are inhabited by a diverse and abundant fauna of aquatic, terrestrial and amphibious species.2. Faunal distribution patterns are determined by interactive processes that reflect the landscape mosaic and complex environmental gradients. The life cycles of many riverine species rely upon a shifting landscape mosaic and other species have become adapted to exploit the characteristically high turn-over of habitats.3. The complex landscape structure provides a diversity of habitats that sustains various successional stages of faunal assemblages. A dynamic riverine landscape sustains biodiversity by providing a variety of refugia and through ecological feedbacks from the organisms themselves (ecosystem engineering).4. The migration of many species, aquatic and terrestrial, is tightly coupled with the temporal and spatial dynamics of the shifting landscape mosaic. Alternation of landscape use by terrestrial and aquatic fauna corresponds to the rise and fall of the flood.

However, the relationship between the occurrence of dead wood and associated species is modified by several environmental factors. Here we review the present state of knowledge on how dead wood on different spatial and temporal scales affects saproxylic biodiversity. We searched for peer-reviewed studies on saproxylic species that compared dead wood distribution on at least two spatial or temporal scales. We scanned close to 300 articles, of which 34 fit our criteria. 20 studies were directed towards the current amount of dead wood at different scale levels and how this relates to the abundance or occurrence of saproxylic species, embracing scales from 10 m to 10 km. 14 studies compared time-lagged effects of dead wood, covering time-lags from 25 years to more than 200 years. The reviewed articles focused mainly on European forest and addressed invertebrates (mostly beetles), alone or in combination with fungi (27 articles), fungi (six articles), or lichens (one article). Although the significance of dead wood for forest biodiversity is firmly established, the reviewed studies show that we still have limited knowledge of the relationship between saproxylic biodiversity and spatial and temporal scales. Based on the reviewed studies, we conclude that there is large variation in response to spatial and temporal dead wood patterns between different taxa and subgroups. Still, several of the reviewed papers indicate that time-lagged effects deserve more attention, especially on a landscape scale and for specialized or red-listed species.

However, quantifying the effect of these pressures is difficult due to the time-lagged responses of biodiversity to landscape change. The aim of this study is to determine if genetic diversity of plant populations exhibits a delayed response to recent landscape change. Using microsatellite markers, we evaluated genetic diversity in 28 populations of a grassland plant Trifolium montanum in Estonian calcareous grasslands. We examined the response of genetic diversity to various current and historic landscape parameters assessed at two time points: (1) 2017, and (2) 1930, when the extent of grasslands in Estonia was at its maximum. Observed heterozygosity (H-O) and inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) were affected by historic grassland availability in the surroundings of the study populations (buffer radius of 2000 m). However, expected heterozygosity (H-E) responded positively to current grassland area and to the availability of grasslands in the surrounding landscape. Allelic richness (A(R)) was positively related to current population size. We found evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks in half of the study populations, indicating that landscape change had a negative impact on population demography and consequent genetic diversity. Our findings suggest that regardless of major habitat loss, some measures of genetic diversity of perennial plant species may not be at equilibrium with landscape change. This calls for caution when interpreting observed patterns of plant genetic diversity and requires consideration of historic landscape context when recommending nature conservation strategies.",NA,NA,"2019","SPRINGER","2019 OCT","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","28","12","3299","3319","10.1007/s10531-019-01822-8","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000486211000012","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Aavik, T. et al.

Grassland plant diversity has declined due to abandonment, changed management methods and production intensification. Current diversity patterns are thus a result of historical and current land use in combination. In this study we investigate the relative importance of historical grassland management and current land use for grassland plant diversity. The distribution of 128 grassland plant species in an agricultural landscape in southwest Sweden was analysed in relation to current land use and land use in three historical time periods; the 18th and the 19th century and around 1960. Land use during the three historical periods was also combined into land-use sequences. Four diversity estimates were used: number of grassland species, number of grassland specialists, Shannon-Wiener index on the specialists and total cover/hectare of specialists. Historical land use - especially 18th century and the land-use sequences - explained more of the variation among study sites than did current land use. Continuity of a specific management type was important for grassland plants as indicated by highest diversities being found in pastures continuously grazed since the 18th century. Former hay meadows, currently grazed, did not differ in any diversity estimate from abandoned hay meadows, indicating that change of management from mowing to grazing a century ago may cause diversity declines similar to abandonment some 40 years ago. Limited artificial fertilisation in the managed areas may have contributed to this effect. Further decline in grassland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape is expected because a substantial proportion of grassland plant populations occur in abandoned areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There are, however, only a few studies that have investigated the relative importance of all of these factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of current and past landscape structures and habitat conditions on species richness at dry grassland-like forest openings in a forested landscape and to assess their relative importance for species richness. We analyzed information on past and present landscape structures using aerial photographs from 1938, 1973, 1988, 2000 and 2007. We calculated the area of each locality and its isolation in the present and in the past and the continuity of localities in GIS. At each locality, we recorded all vascular plant species (296 species in 110 forest openings) and information on abiotic conditions of the localities. We found that the current species richness of the forest openings was significantly determined by local habitat conditions as well as by landscape structure in the present and in the past. The highest species richness was observed on larger and more heterogeneous localities with rocks and shallow soils, which were already large and well connected to other localities in 1938. The changes in the landscape structure in the past can thus have strong effects on current species richness. Future studies attempting to understand determinants of species diversity in fragmented landscapes should also include data on past landscape structure, as it may in fact be more important than the present structure.",NA,NA,"2014","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2014 MAY 8","PLOS ONE","9","5",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0097110","1932-6203","WOS:000338213300123","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Article","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Husakova, Iveta et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Sax, Dov F. and Gaines, Steven D.","Species invasions and extinction: The future of native biodiversity on islands","Predation by exotic species has caused the extinction of many native animal species on islands, whereas competition from exotic plants has caused few native plant extinctions. Exotic plant addition to islands is highly nonrandom, with an almost perfect 1 to 1 match between the number of naturalized and native plant species on oceanic islands. Here, we evaluate several alternative implications of these findings. Does the consistency of increase in plant richness across islands imply that a saturation point in species richness has been reached? If not, should we expect total plant richness to continue to increase as new species are added? Finally, is the rarity of native plant extinctions to date a misleading measure of the impact of past invasions, one that hides an extinction debt that will be paid in the future? By analyzing historical records, we show that the number of naturalized plant species has increased linearly over time on many individual islands. Further, the mean ratio of naturalized to native plant species across islands has changed steadily for nearly two centuries. These patterns suggest that many more species will become naturalized on islands in the future. We also discuss how dynamics of invasion bear upon alternative saturation scenarios and the implications these scenarios have for the future retention or extinction of native plant species. Finally, we identify invasion-motivated research gaps (propagule pressure, time-lags to extinction, abundance shifts, and loss of area) that can aid in forecasting extinction and in developing a more comprehensive theory of species extinctions.",NA,NA,"2008","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2008 AUG 12","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","105",NA,"11490","11497","10.1073/pnas.0802290105","0027-8424","WOS:000258561200006","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Sax, Dov F. et al.

Usually, they are scattered patches in surrounding forests. The spontaneous expansion of trees and shrubs, favored by the recent decline of mountain agriculture, lead the maggengo patches patterns and shapes to change. Our objective was to analyze the effect of this change on current plant diversity of the remnant patches, as the adaptive response could be slow and possibly related more to historical than to current landscape patterns. We analyzed the trend of the size, shape, elongation, fractal dimension and connectivity of maggengo patches of a Central-Eastern Italian Alpine district, in four time steps, from 1973 to 2006, and in 1859, when mountain agriculture was still widespread. Then, we studied the relationships between those landscape metrics and two current patch-level plant diversity measures: interior species richness and species density. Aerial photographs were used to investigate that trend, while a historical cadastral map was used to assess the landscape metrics in 1859. As expected, in the last 30 years, the total size of maggenghi has been reduced by 57% while their shapes have been progressively simplified. Interior species richness was positively related to size, both in 2006 and over the past 30 years, but not to any 1859 measures. Conversely, species density was positively correlated only with 1859 size, shape index and connectivity.

We here used high-resolution data from the french breeding bird survey to quantify and map the deviation between spatial and temporal patterns of bird abundances resulting from the dynamics of 124 species monitored in 2133 sites between 2001 and 2012. Using independent empirical data, we then tested specific predictions linked to the determinants (anthropogenic activities) and processes (lagged responses to environmental changes) potentially generating these deviations. We found that deviations between spatial and temporal patterns of abundances were particularly structured in space for bird communities. Following our predictions, these space-time deviations were positively correlated with the human influence on ecosystems, and linked with colonization-extinction ratios and community completeness, two markers of ongoing delayed responses to environmental changes. Our results suggest that the deviations between spatial and temporal patterns are related to recent anthropogenic environmental changes and disequilibrium responses to these changes. Investigating deviations between spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity might open promising perspectives for a formal quantification of disequilibrium state of biodiversity at large spatial scale.",NA,NA,"2021","WILEY","2021 AUG","OIKOS","130","8","1284","1296","10.1111/oik.08289","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000650956200001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gauzere, Pierre et al.

Such species are thought to be resilient to disturbance, but may carry an extinction debt due to reproductive failure. Genetic studies of Australian arid zone plant species suggest an unusually high frequency of asexuality, polyploidy, or both. A preliminary AFLP genetic study implied that the naturally fragmented arid zone tree, Acacia carneorum, is almost entirely dependent on asexual reproduction through suckering, and stands may have lacked genetic diversity and interconnection even prior to the onset of European pastoralism. Here we surveyed microsatellite genetic variation in 20 stands to test for variation in life histories and further assessed the conservation status of the species by comparing genetic diversity within protected stands in National Parks and disturbed range lands. Using herbarium records, we estimate that 219 stands are extant, all of which occur in the arid zone, west of the Darling River in southeastern Australia. With two exceptions, all surveyed stands comprised only one multilocus genet and at least eight were putatively polyploid. Although some stands comprise thousands of stems, our findings imply that the species as a whole may represent similar to 240 distinct genetic individuals, many of which are polyploid, and most are separated by >10km of unsuitable habitat. With only 34% of stands (and therefore genets) occurring within conservation reserves, A.carneorum may be at much greater risk of extinction than inferred from on-ground census data. Land managers should prioritize on-ground preservation of the genotypes within existing reserves, protecting both vegetative suckers and seedlings from herbivory. Importantly, three stands are known to set viable seed and should be used to generate genetically diverse germ-plasm for ex situ conservation, population augmentation, or translocation.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 NOV","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","7","22","9451","9460","10.1002/ece3.3246","2045-7758","WOS:000415900800021","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Roberts, David G. et al.

To assess the diversity and abundance of this wildlife, recent changes in these parameters, and the value of wildlife and bushland fragments to residents of Brisbane, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 300 households each located adjacent to one of 38 urban bushland fragments. A total of 172 surveys (57%) were returned, producing 768 records of 83 fauna species, dominated by birds and mammals; bandicoots were widely reported from the 38 fragments. Several historical records provided evidence of recent local extinctions within fragments, highlighting the continuing declines in various species of native wildlife within Brisbane. Several human-wildlife conflicts were identified, but overall residents were tolerant of such conflicts. Bandicoots were disliked by a small minority (3%) of residents owing to the holes they dig in lawns and gardens in search of food. and their potential as vectors of ticks.

The extent to which habitat fragmentation leads to population fragmentation, however, differs among landscapes and taxa. Commonly, researchers use information on the current status of a species to predict population effects of habitat fragmentation. Such methods, however, do not convey information on species-specific responses to fragmentation. Here, we compare levels of past population differentiation, estimated from microsatellite genotypes, with contemporary dispersal rates, estimated from multi-strata capture-recapture models, to infer changes in mobility over time in seven sympatric, forest-dependent bird species of a Kenyan cloud forest archipelago. Overall, populations of sedentary species were more strongly differentiated and clustered compared to those of vagile ones, while geographical patterning suggested an important role of landscape structure in shaping genetic variation. However, five of seven species with broadly similar levels of genetic differentiation nevertheless differed substantially in their current dispersal rates. We conclude that post-fragmentation levels of vagility, without reference to past population connectivity, may not be the best predictor of how forest fragmentation affects the life history of forest-dependent species. As effective conservation strategies often hinge on accurate prediction of shifts in ecological and genetic relationships among populations, conservation practices based solely upon current population abundances or movements may, in the long term, prove to be inadequate.",NA,NA,"2011","WILEY","2011 MAY","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","20","9","1829","1844","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05028.x","0962-1083 and 1365-294X","WOS:000289522400006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Callens, Tom et al.

The Chinese paddlefish, Psephurus gludius, was one of only two extant members of a relict lineage that was most diverse and widespread 34-75 million years ago. It is also one of the largest freshwater fish species, reaching up to 7 m in length. The Chinese paddlefish was once common in the Yangtze River, with c.25 t being harvested per annum during the 1970s. Populations have, however, declined drastically since the late 1970s as a result of overfishing and habitat fragmentation. Here, a basin-wide capture survey during 2017-2018 found 332 fish species, but did not find a single specimen of Chinese paddlefish. Furthermore, 140 historically reported fish species have not been found and most of them are considered highly endangered. Based on 210 sightings of Chinese paddlefish during the period 1981-2003, we estimated the timing of extinction to be by 2005, and no later than by 2010. In addition, the paddlefish probably became functionally extinct (i.e. it was unable to reproduce) by 1993. before it went extinct. It is likely that the lack of reproduction was among the major causes of extinction. As no individuals exist in captivity, and no living tissues are conserved for potential resurrection, the fish should be considered extinct according to the IUCN Red List criteria. The delayed extinction of Chinese paddlefish resulted from multiple threats, suggesting that optimizing conservation efforts on endangered Yangtze fauna is urgently needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, groups from different life-stages are likely to exhibit divergent shifts in species diversity and community composition, yet greatly neglected in ecological studies. We sampled adult and juvenile tree assemblages at twenty sites of Brazilian Atlantic Forest surrounded by different percentages of forest cover remaining at the landscape-level (3-93%) to compare patterns of species richness and community composition between both life-stages in response to habitat amount. We also investigated distinct functional guild responses (proportion of species and stems of shade-intolerant, biotically-dispersed and large-seeded species) among adult and juvenile trees to forest cover reduction. We hypothesize that juveniles will exhibit dissimilar community composition, faster responses, and higher vulnerability of functional guilds to forest loss than adults. Our results indicate that community composition was markedly different among life-stages and strongly correlated with forest cover. Additionally, the number of species of both life-stages was negatively affected by landscape-scale forest loss, exhibiting a greater decline of species richness when forest cover was reduced to < 19.5% and 34.6% of forest cover, for adults and juveniles, respectively. Forest loss might led to non-random floristic shifts, characterized by an increased proportional representation of shade-intolerant species and stems from both life-stages, a severe decline of biotically dispersed adult species, and reduction in large-seeded juvenile species in severely deforested landscapes. Of uppermost importance, our results show that young assemblages are not mirroring the preceding generation, indicating that future woody plant communities are likely to exhibit an impoverished sample of the original biota with subsequent loss of functionality in deforested landscapes. Given that 20% of native vegetation at the property-scale is the legal minimum amount required by the current Brazilian Forest Code in the Atlantic Forest, we reveal that this amount is not enough to safeguard diverse plant communities particularly juveniles, an essential group of population dynamics, which require greater forest cover amount at the landscape-scale.

Changes in the landscape were inferred from historical maps (1850 and 1900) and aerial photographs (1945 and 2001).2 We tested whether predictions for the current species distribution are affected by assumptions about its early 19th century distribution, to determine whether recent history and current processes are dominant, and how past landscape changes determine current distributions.3 Initial conditions influence predictions of current distribution, suggesting that the current distribution still partly reflects the distribution of the species in the early 19th century. A period of 150 years is too short for Succisa to have spread extensively if dispersal parameters are given realistic values.4 Simulations in which present-day land-use patterns were imposed at earlier dates showed that changes in landscape structure over the past 175 years also had a strong effect on the present-day habitat occupancy and population sizes of Succisa.5 The dominant process for Succisa now is extinction from marginal habitats. It is therefore likely that the (relatively) high present-day occupation patterns are still due to much larger areas having been available in the past rather than to successful dispersal. Although the species has responded to landscape changes, there is little evidence of population sizes reaching equilibrium.6 Our approach shows that the wealth of landscape information available from historical maps can be linked with data on population biology by means of dynamical models that can make predictions about species dynamics.",NA,NA,"2006","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","2006 JAN","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","94","1","131","143","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01063.x","0022-0477","WOS:000234028800013","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Herben, T et al.

Here we use a combination of alternative, qualitative approaches (expert opinion, historical records and temporal replication of surveys) to standardised monitoring and mapping programs to investigate the extent of change of a peri-urban butterfly assemblage. This assemblage, comprising 52 species, of which 46 are residents or seasonal immigrants, was studied at three spatial scales (local similar to 0.01 km(2), intermediate similar to 9 km(2) and regional similar to 100 km(2)) in the Eltham district near Melbourne based on presence/absence data over the past 40 (1981-2020) and 80 years (1941-2020). We then consider the causal factors or drivers that have led to changes, and we explore the timing and ecological patterns underpinning extirpations. Long-term records reveal substantial changes (mostly decline) in composition and species richness of the 46 breeding species at all spatial scales and time frames analysed. Although the magnitude and rate of decline were higher at the smaller, local to intermediate scales (29-43% decline over 40 years, loss rate of 0.20-0.25 species/year) compared with the larger, regional scale (26% decline over 80 years, loss rate of 0.15 species/year), extirpations at the larger scale were more alarming because they are indicative of widespread population collapse. Declines in relative abundance and occupancy were also recorded at the intermediate and regional spatial scales. Further decline (extinction debt) is anticipated for several ecological specialists currently known from very few sites. Historical extirpations mostly involved obligate myrmecophilous lycaenids and appear to have been largely driven by an interaction of urbanisation (habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation) and vegetation encroachment. More recent extirpations consist mainly of grass-feeding and mistletoe-feeding specialists and are more worrying because they have predominantly occurred within the past 20-30 years. An interaction of urbanisation (tree canopy death and decline of mistletoes and their host trees from ecosystem dysfunction) and climate change (water stress and heat waves) are considered to be the most likely drivers for these ecological guilds.",NA,NA,"2021","WILEY","2021 FEB","AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY","60","1","27","51","10.1111/aen.12514","2052-1758 and 2052-174X","WOS:000607519700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Braby, Michael F. et al.

This is why conservationists value predictive models that can flag plant species that may not keep pace with global warming.Aims To identify which plant traits best explain migration potential in woody species by reanalysing a dataset of tree distribution ranges in Europe.Methods We used two statistical approaches to quantify migration lag. A direct approach compared frequency of large trees in the two latitudinal extremes and a modelling approach in which we first corrected data for the influence of temperature and then assessed the influence of latitude over the entire distribution of the tree species.Results Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed mass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more.Conclusion We interpret our results in terms of the well-established trade-off between seed mass and seed production in spermatophytes and discuss the possible functional implications that will result from selectively losing large-seeded trees.

Here, we compared species (SD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) (alpha) diversity among 272 dry grassland patches of two age-classes: old and new, with the new patches being dry grasslands established on previous intensively managed fields during the last 30 years. We first compared SD, FD and PD, between patches of different age. Then, we performed generalized linear models to determine the influence of abiotic, present-day and historical landscape configuration variables on SD, FD and PD. By measuring abiotic variables, we explained the effect of environmental filtering on species diversity, whereas the present-day and historical landscape configuration variables were included to describe how the spatial and temporal configuration of the patches influence patterns of species. Finally, we applied partial regressions to explore the relative importance of abiotic, present-day and historical variables in explaining the diversity metrics and how this varies between patches of different ages. We found higher SD in the old compared to the new patches, but no changes in FD and PD. SD was mostly affected by abiotic and present-day landscape configuration variables in the new and the old patches, respectively. In the new patches, historical variables explained variation in the FD, while present-day variables explained the PD. In the old patches, historical variables accounted for most of the variation in both FD and PD. Our evidence suggests that the relative importance of assembly processes has changed over time, showing that environmental filtering and changes in the landscape configuration prevented the establishment of species in the new patches.

How spatial configuration of patches in fragmented habitats influences biodiversity remains largely controversial. Here, we propose a framework to extend the species-area relationship (SAR) approach to analyze how changes in habitat configuration affect species richness in fragmented habitats. We use hypothetical communities that are characterized by (1) their tolerance to human activities, (2) the dispersal capability of the individuals of any species, (3) the SAR, and (4) the species turnover among patches. Further, the species turnover is a function of (4a) the predictability of species survival and (4b) the species recolonization odds. In our framework, we identify three extreme communities that encompass the richness of all potential different communities, and thus encapsulate the richness of real communities. We propose a graph to visualize the effect of different patch sizes on species richness, an index to quantify those changes, and a second graph using the index to visualize the effect of distance between patches on species richness. After applying our framework and tools to the Tropical Andes, we found strong differences in the impact of natural vs. human-driven fragmentation on richness between biomes. When projecting future richness values under climate change scenarios, the largest sources of uncertainty in our richness calculation (>90%) were species turnover among patches and species dispersal for most of the biomes rather than future climate or species tolerance to human activities. Habitat loss consistently decreased the species richness; however, fragmentation per se often increased it. The increment was mostly linked to the species turnover rate among patches. Our framework is a new theoretical tool to study the main patterns that underlie regional richness and therefore can provide new insights to face spatial habitat reconfiguration caused by human activities.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 NOV","ECOSPHERE","8","11",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2004","2150-8925","WOS:000417330000016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Arnillas, Carlos Alberto et al.

In historically fragmented forests, however, species have evolved under fragmented conditions and might be more resistant to matrix modification. We examined the effect of contemporary matrix modification on forest regeneration potential in historically fragmented scarp-forest fragments in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We compared tree, seedling and sapling richness, abundance and composition in four forest-fragment types varying in size and matrix modification: large and small forest fragments surrounded by indigenous grassland and small forest fragments enclosed by eucalypt and sugarcane plantations. Additionally, seedlings and saplings were classified according to their origin as local/immigrant to assess matrix permeability for seed dispersers. Trees and saplings were slightly, and seedlings were strongly affected by matrix modification: seedling richness and abundance were significantly lower in fragments with sugarcane compared to fragments with grassland matrix. Furthermore, all stage classes revealed compositional differences with more light-tolerant species occurring in fragments with modified matrices. We suggest that human activities associated with matrix modification have altered abiotic factors favouring light-tolerant species. Changes in biotic interactions seemed to be less important as immigrant recruitment occurred in all fragments implying matrix permeability. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary matrix modification might threaten forest regeneration potential in historical scarp-forest fragments. Reduced seedling recruitment might indicate a time lag in local species extinction, as trees regenerate slowly. We recommend using both recruitment stages as early warning indicators.

Many bird species declined during the recent long drought in south-eastern Australia. Research over the last decade has strongly emphasised effects at the landscape level. It is now clear that more native vegetation in the landscape leads to more bird species. There is stronger evidence that aggressive and nest-predatory birds contribute to the decline of many woodland birds. Several studies have linked the presence of individual bird species to key habitat features, such as high or low density of trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris. The main priorities for the conservation of woodland birds to reverse these declines are: (1) detailed studies on the population dynamics of a variety of declining woodland birds under different management regimes; (2) experiments that closely monitor the response of woodland birds to manipulation of competitors, predators and habitat features; and (3) broad-scale implementation of management based on science to aim to reverse the fortunes of woodland birds on regional and national scales.",NA,NA,"2011","CSIRO PUBLISHING","2011","EMU","111","1","1","9","10.1071/MU09115","0158-4197 and 1448-5540","WOS:000287529500002","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","Review","CLAYTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ford, Hugh A.

"JOUR",NA,"Wood, Jamie R. and Wilmshurst, Janet M.","Changes in New Zealand forest plant communities following the prehistoric extinction of avian megaherbivores","QuestionsFollowing the mid 15th century AD extinction of moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) there was a similar to 400-yr period when large herbivores were absent from New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems. This ended with the introduction of mammalian herbivores by European settlers in the 19th century. For at least 40yr researchers have speculated about how New Zealand's vegetation communities might have responded to the herbivore gap'. Did plant taxa once consumed by moa flourish in forest understoreys without large herbivores to browse them? Did forest understoreys become denser, preventing regeneration of long-lived conifers and altering forest composition? Such questions remain to be tested using palaeoecological records.LocationThree locations on South Island, New Zealand (from <20 to 750m a.s.l) where forest has not been burned since human settlement, and where there has been no obvious geological or climatic disturbance events over the past 1000yr that have influenced vegetation dynamics.MethodsWe identified and quantified pollen grains and fern spores from soil/peat cores taken beneath, or adjacent to, tall forest canopies. Soil/peat samples from the cores were radiocarbon dated and Bayesian age-depth models were constructed for each core, from which depths corresponding to the herbivore gap period were identified. Changes in pollen/spore abundances occurring within the herbivore gap were identified and critically examined for consistency between cores and likelihood of being caused by loss of browsing pressure from large herbivores (through comparison with plant taxa known to have been consumed by moa).ResultsGround fern spores and Coprosma pollen exhibited increases in relative abundance at all three sites during the herbivore gap. Both occur frequently in moa coprolites and gizzard content, and so can be interpreted as possible responses to moa extinction. However, other changes in pollen assemblages at this time were inconsistent between sites, or could be better explained as being related to anthropogenic burning in the local region.ConclusionsNew Zealand forest plant communities appear to have experienced only relatively minor changes during the herbivore gap. Our results contradict long-standing hypotheses that shrubs and ferns had flourished in New Zealand forest understoreys at this time, preventing podocarp regeneration. However, due to the relatively recent extinction of moa, and long life span of many forest trees, there may be an extinction debt where the long-term consequences of moa extinction are still to be fully realized.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 JAN","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","28","1","160","171","10.1111/jvs.12469","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000395422900016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Wood, Jamie R. et al.

However, the effect of bamboo expansion associated to human activity on seedling communities in tropical forests remains poorly known. We investigated the correlation of the native bamboo Guadua tagoara presence for a year on the abundance, richness, diversity, dominance, evenness, emergence, mortality, and growth of the first months of the native seedlings establishment in an Atlantic forest area, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Bamboo presence favored the initial establishment of the palm Euterpe edulis seedlings but altered seedling community structure as a whole. Species richness did not differ between bamboo and nonbamboo dominated habitats, but abundance, diversity, and evenness did. Bamboo habitats showed higher seedling abundance, emergence, and mortality than in habitats without bamboos. However, diversity was lower in these habitats. Our results shed light on the role of bamboo presence in limiting early establishment of native seedlings but favoring the first months of establishment of E. edulis, the dominant species in bamboo habitats (70%). Therefore, the monitoring of more specific variables could be included (i.e., bamboo culm density, soil type, decomposition of organic matter, fauna living, or foraging in bamboos) in future studies to better understand the consequences of bamboo dominance on the recruitment and dynamics of tropical forests biodiversity in the long term.",NA,NA,"2018","Sage Publications","2018","Tropical Conservation Science","11",NA,"unpaginated","unpaginated",NA,"1940-0829","CABI:20193175724","Thousand Oaks","Journal article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rother, D.

Butterflies and burnet moths","We counted butterflies in almost all open grasslands in an area of 8000 hectare over five years (2001-2005) in the central part of the parish of Stenbrohult, southern Sweden (Fig. 1; 56 degrees 37' N, 14 degrees 11' O). This area is currently dominated by forests. Grasslands, mainly grazed by cattle and horses, only cover about 6 % of the area. The study area consisted of 18 farms, most ot them are surrounded by coniferous forests and some bordering lakes. Three farms are protected as nature reserves and more reserves are planned for at least four more farms. Habitat types were mapped on each farm (Table 1). Standardized transects counts, with 6 - 8 annual visits evenly spread over the period from the middle of May to the middle of August, were performed in all 18 farms. The annual maximal counts of butterflies and burnet moths at one occasion in each subarea and year are presented (Appendix). The sum of these were 56 682 individuals of 46 species of butterflies and 2 791 individuals of 4 species of burnet moths. One individual each of two additional species, Limenitis populi in 2000 and Issoria lathonia in 2003, was found outside the standardized counts. Many species were recorded in low numbers in 2001 and high in 2003, some increasing by an order of magnitude. There were also a very high variation of species richness and numbers of individual species between the different farms. The highest number of species were found on farms in the central part of the study-area and on farms with traditionally managed and unfertilized hay-meadows. We discuss the possible causes of these variations. Our results show that monitoring schemes must include many plots and years to reveal population trends due to land management changes. Many species occurred in low numbers and since suitable habitats have decreased they may constitute an extinction debt, e.g. Pyrgus malvae, Leptidea sinapis, Aporia crataegi, Coenonympha pamphilus, Lasiommata maera, Polyommatus semiargus and Zygeana.filipendulae.

"JOUR",NA,"Martin, Tara G. and Arcese, Peter and Scheerder, Nanda","Browsing down our natural heritage: Deer impacts on vegetation structure and songbird populations across an island archipelago","Declines in forest and woodland birds have largely been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation. In the past decade, however, the potential for herbivores to influence bird species abundance and community composition via their direct impact on vegetation structure has also been recognised. We tested the hypothesis that deer influence vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a large island archipelago in western North America using surveys of 18 islands with deer densities ranging from 0 to over 1 deer/ha. Amongst these islands, reduced predation and hunting pressure has allowed deer populations to increase above those likely to have existed in pre-European times. Our results support a growing body of evidence that deer regulate both the cover and architecture of understory vegetation which in turn profoundly affects island bird assemblages. Deer-free islands supported the most abundant and diverse bird fauna. Iconic songbirds such as the rufous hummingbird, song and fox sparrow were abundant on islands with no deer but substantially reduced on islands with high deer densities. Only one bird species, the dark-eyed junco, preferred moderate and high density deer islands. Our observations suggest that current cohorts of palatable shrubs on islands with high deer densities are relatively old and potentially represent an impending extinction debt, where the full effects of high deer density on island biota may take decades to fully unfold. Our results suggest that deer densities below a threshold of 0.1 deer/ha should allow native vegetation to recover and a rich and diverse bird species assemblage to persist. We suggest that adaptive management be used to test the validity of this threshold, and that without active management of deer abundance, local extinctions of native flora and fauna appear likely to accelerate.

However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: ""dispersal lags"" affecting plant species' spread along elevational gradients, ""establishment lags"" following their arrival in recipient communities, and ""extinction lags"" of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species' range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming. Our review and simulation support the view that accounting for disequilibrium range dynamics will be essential for realistic forecasts of patterns of biodiversity under climate change, with implications for the conservation of mountain species and the ecosystem functions they provide.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 FEB","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","24","2","563","579","10.1111/gcb.13976","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000423994700031","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Alexander, Jake M. et al.

Uncertainties remain for how communities of microorganisms respond to landscape structure over time, and whether some groups of microorganisms react more than others. Here, we investigated if fungal or bacterial diversity is driven by the amount of forest cover in the current or the past landscape. We tested the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH) on ancient forests of the Cevennes national park, that experienced increased fragmentation 150 years ago, and are today surrounded by recent forests. As ancient forests are often more diverse in plant species, we hypothesized that the higher quantity of ancient forests in the landscape, the richer local fungal and bacterial communities would be. More precisely, we expected that ectomycorrhizal fungi, and pathotrophic fungi, often indicators of mature forests, would be also more sensitive to forest history and therefore to the quantity of ancient forests than bacteria and saprotrophic fungi. We sampled 40 soil cores per 0.5 ha, pooled in 8 composite samples per plot in 27 landscapes and sequenced ITS1 and 16S markers by Illumina-Mi seq. To identify functional groups of fungi, we relied on their taxonomy and the use of public databases. Our results partly follow the HAH, as fungal richness was positively related with the quantity of ancient forests in the landscape and not by the focal patch size. Ectomycorrhizal and pathotrophic fungi were positively affected by the ancient forest cover, and so were saprotrophic ones, but not bacteria. Local factors also shaped the communities such as soil composition and elevation, confirming classical patterns in soil microbial ecology. Interestingly, past landscape structure was better at explaining fungal community richness than contemporary landscape, suggesting a time lag in the response of communities to landscape modification and a potential extinction debt. Our results reveal the importance of below-ground communities in studies of landscape and historical ecology, with their structure and functions likely to be intimately linked with soil and landscape history.

Different functional groups may have specific roles within the ecosystem processes and costly conservation efforts should be targeted at species of conservation concern. Therefore, an analysis of how functional or ecological groups recover following disturbance could provide more precise information than the recovery of taxonomic groups alone. We studied the recovery rate of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi in a boreal landscape where forest use had ceased more than 60 years ago. The forests in our study areas had a variable utilization history. The stands located near abandoned settlements were former scrubland. The adjacent stands formed a selectively cut zone and were followed by stands deeper in the forest matrix that were largely in pristine condition. We recorded boletoid, agaricoid and aphyllophoroid fungi species numbers in 0.25 ha sample plots at 500 m intervals along seven 2-2.5 km long transects. The transects started at the edge of the forest next to the abandoned settlements. Distance (intensity of previous forest utilization) did not affect the species richness of the taxonomic or functional groups of fungi, although the number of aphyllophoroid species of conservation concern was 50% lower in the forests that had been utilized in the past than in the surrounding pristine forests. Moreover, in stands close to the villages, the composition of aphyllophoroid species (beta diversity) differed from that of more distant and less utilized stands. Our results would suggest that the majority of ecosystem properties provided by higher fungi groups seem to recover within one century. However, the slow pace of accumulation of dead wood in an advanced state of decay probably slows the recovery of aphyllophoroid species of conservation concern.",NA,NA,"2017","SPRINGER","2017 DEC","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH","136","5-6","827","837","10.1007/s10342-017-1073-0","1612-4669 and 1612-4677","WOS:000417160500005","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tikkanen, Olli-Pekka et al.

Here we demonstrate such a case, wherein anthropogenic activity and structures facilitate the dispersal of a species whose capacity for territorial expansion is limited in the natural environment. Using habitat suitability and connectivity models, we show that the Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis) most likely prefers railways as a means to disperse into new habitats and/or maintain population connectivity across a fragmented habitat (i.e. from their southern populations, moving north along rail way tracks to colonize new suitable habitats).

In this study, the effects of present and past landscape structures on carabid and spider communities were investigated.

We used permanent plots to document changes in habitat quality by monitoring herbaceous-layer plant species presence and cover over a decade (1996/97 and 2007) in two peri-urban nature preserves in central Indiana, U.S.A. The preserves are comprised of different forest community types: wet-mesic depressional forest and mesic upland forest. Habitat characteristics, based on Floristic Quality Assessment parameters, showed only a single change for either preserve between survey years: wetness values were lower in the wet-mesic depressional site in 2007 than in 1996, indicating more plants with affinity for wet soil. No changes in community structure (total species richness, evenness, and diversity) were found. The number of nonnative species increased between survey years, especially in the wet-mesic depressional forest, where numbers went from zero to six, five of which are classified as invasive. There was considerable turnover in individual species presence, with perennial forb species the most likely species to be found in only 1 y or the other. Species did not rearrange themselves within plots, but completely appeared or disappeared from all plots within a preserve between the sample years, suggesting that species composition of the flora is dynamic.

However, several processes can lead to a same pattern. Focusing on observed, short-term patterns limits our ability to make inferences about ecological processes and responses to environmental change over time. In this study, we assessed changes in occupancy of two primate species in southeastern Brazil, following a major habitat loss due to implementation of a hydroelectric dam. Occupancy was assessed before dam construction and 11 years after, while explicitly accounting for imperfect detection. We assessed the effect of forest patch size and isolation on occupancy and rates of extinction and colonization, driven by landscape modification. Then we calculated occupancy under metapopulation equilibrium and expected time-lags resulting from non-equilibrium. We compared two primate species inhabiting forest patches, the black penciled marmoset Callithrix penicilatta and the black-fronted titi monkey Calliceb us nigrifrons, with markedly different ecological characteristics. Those differences may explain why occupancy dynamics were driven by distinct elements. A fast response to habitat changes was observed only for marmoset, an opportunistic species. However, non-equilibrium states and the possibility of time-lag effects were observed for titi monkey, a species dependent on forest habitat. Our analyses support the need to establish long term monitoring and assess system vital rates overtime. A single snapshot in time may lead to erroneous interpretations of a species response to habitat alteration. (C) 2015 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

Resource competition (R*) theory can describe dynamics within patches or hosts, and metacommunity dynamics describe competition-colonization trade-offs, extinction debts, and superinfection. However, models at this broader scale often assume instantaneous competitive exclusion in co-inhabited patches or co-infected hosts. Impacts of more gradual competitive exclusion on the abundance, distribution, and diversity of species are less clear. Here, we nest a general resource competition model within a metacommunity framework and manipulate the relative timescales for processes operating within and among patches/hosts. We focus on superinfection in pathogen communities. We compare cases where transmission depends on infection prevalence vs. the abundance of pathogens within hosts. Surprisingly, slowing the relative pace of competitive exclusion within hosts can decrease infection prevalence of the inferior competitor and increase prevalence of the superior competitor, depending on transmission and virulence. Slower within-host dynamics reduce the abundance of both pathogens within hosts and promote diversity at multiple scales: co-infections within individual hosts and co-occurrence in the host population.

Recently, in Japan, due to an economic recession, some previously developed lands have become vacant. Little is known, however, about the legacy of earlier earthmoving, which involves topsoil removal and ground leveling before residential construction, on plant community composition in such vacant lots. To understand (dis)assembly processes in vacant lots, we studied 24 grasslands in a suburban region in Japan: 12 grasslands that had experienced earthmoving and 12 that had not. We surveyed plant community composition and species richness, and clarified compositional turnover (replacement of species) and nestedness (nonrandom species loss) by distance-based beta-diversities, which were summarized by PCoA analysis. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to examine the effects of soil properties, mowing frequency, past and present habitat connectivities on compositional changes. As a result, past earthmoving, mowing frequency, soil properties, and past habitat connectivity were found to be the drivers of compositional turnover. In particular, we found legacy effects of earthmoving: earthmoving promoted turnover from native grassland species to weeds in arable lands or roadside by altering soil properties. Mowing frequency also promoted the same turnover, implying that extensive rather than intensive mowing can modify the negative legacy effects and maintain grassland species. Decrease in present habitat connectivity marginally enhanced nonrandom loss of native grassland species (nestedness). Present habitat connectivity had a positive effect on species richness, highlighting the important roles of contemporary dispersal. Our study demonstrates that community assembly is a result of multiple processes differing in spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that extensive mowing at local scale, as well as giving a high conservation priority to grasslands with high habitat connectivity at regional scale, is the promising actions to maintain endangered native grassland species in suburban landscapes with negative legacy effects of earthmoving.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 FEB","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","10","3","1311","1323","10.1002/ece3.5985","2045-7758","WOS:000506416600001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tsuzuki, Yoichi et al.

Here, we highlight arguments for the necessary inclusion of land-use legacies in this endeavour. Alterations in resources and conditions engendered by previous land use, together with influences on plant community processes such as dispersal, selection, drift and speciation, have steered communities and ecosystem functions onto trajectories of change. These trajectories may be modulated by contemporary environmental changes such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition. We performed a literature review which suggests that these potential interactions have rarely been investigated. This crucial oversight is potentially due to an assumption that knowledge of the contemporary state allows accurate projection into the future. Lessons from other complex dynamic systems, and the recent recognition of the importance of previous conditions in explaining contemporary and future ecosystem properties, demand the testing of this assumption. Vegetation resurvey databases across gradients of land use and environmental change, complemented by rigorous experiments, offer a means to test for interactions between land-use legacies and multiple environmental changes. Implementing these tests in the context of a trait-based framework will allow biologists to synthesize compositional and functional ecosystem responses.

In attempting to anticipate the needs of a constantly changing future, preservationists need to plan for a range of eventualities, consider new strategies, and determine how these strategies can be tested. Interestingly, appropriate adaptive strategies may exist in past cultural responses to harsh and shifting environments, like our coastal areas and barrier islands. One such historic coastal community, which represents the unique type of heritage and sense of place that preservationists work to protect and is currently at risk due to sea level rise, is Portsmouth Village on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The particular responses and adaptations to a challenging and ever-changing environment, which were developed and adopted by residents of Portsmouth Village to address environmental forces, offer some clues for possible future responses to climate change.

We illustrate how population trends can be studied using a presence/absence method for a species that is inappropriate for a demographic study. The four other criteria concern habitat fragmentation, the human footprint in the surrounding landscape, observed impacts on a population and elements of habitat structure and quality that may impinge on population status. Each criterion is assessed with various indicators that can be adapted to the biology and ecology of the studied species. To test the feasibility of the proposed framework, we perform a case study of a Mediterranean geophyte Allium chamaemoly L., a species listed for protection in France. The results show a wide range of conservation status among a regional set of populations in the study species. Variation among the indicators used to assess different criteria illustrates the importance of assessing a range of different factors and ways to combine them if population conservation status is to be objectively identified. The study of diverse criteria may allow for a more precise assessment of the causes of differences in conservation status among populations of a single species. The framework of five criteria could be adapted by modification or substitution of indicators or adaptation of thresholds among classes, and thus be applied to other species of conservation importance.

This is clearly not the case for state, regional or national floras in the USA where colonization (i.e. invasion by exotic species) exceeds extirpation by roughly a 24 to 1 margin. We report an alarming temporal trend in plant invasions in the Pacific Northwest over the past 100 years whereby counties highest in native species richness appear increasingly invaded over time. Despite the possibility of some increased awareness and reporting of native and exotic plant species in recent decades, historical records show a significant, consistent long-term increase in exotic species (number and frequency) at county, state and regional scales in the Pacific Northwest. Here, as in other regions of the country, colonization rates by exotic species are high and extirpation rates are negligible.

Their closed canopies also have different microclimatic conditions compared with better studied conservation areas. We studied three beetle families (click, longhorn, and rove beetles) with different ecological demands in lowland plantation forests dominated by Sessile oak and Norway spruce in the Czech Republic. Our main interest was how their species richness, abundance, diversity, body length, rarity, red-list status, species composition and individual species were driven by the main tree species, stand area and canopy openness. We analyzed 3466 individuals from 198 beetle species and the results revealed complex and contrasting responses of the studied beetle families - click beetles mostly preferred sun-exposure and spruce as the dominant tree species, longhorn beetles mainly preferred large stands, whereas rove beetles were mostly influenced by oak as the dominant tree species and increasing area. We also observed that some species had different preferences in plantation forests than is known from the literature. The main conclusions of our results are that the dominance of non-natural spruce plantations and a large stand area (both originating from artificially replanted large clear-cuts) did not affect the majority of the studied taxa as we expected.

"JOUR",NA,"Junninen, Kaisa and Komonen, Atte","Conservation ecology of boreal polypores: A review","Here we quantitatively summarize the conservation ecology of one group of dead-wood-dependent organisms, the polyporous fungi, in boreal Europe. At the substrate scale, the decay stage is the strongest determinant of species richness, with large (>20 cm diameter) downed logs hosting more species than other dead-wood types. At the stand scale, the amount of dead wood is the strongest determinant of poly-pore species richness; the minimum average amount of dead wood for the occurrence of rare polypores appears to be 20-40 m(3)/ha. Species-area analysis shows that in mature boreal forests species accumulation levels off at around 20-30 ha. This leads us to suggest a heuristic 20/20/20 rule of thumb: a 20 ha stand, with an average of 20 m(3)/ha of dead wood of which many are logs >20 cm, is likely to be the minimum for the ecologically justified conservation of polypore diversity at the stand scale in boreal Europe. Equally crucial for polypore diversity, however, is the current and historic extent of suitable habitats at the landscape scale. The time lag between the isolation of a habitat patch and the new equilibrium in the number or occurrence of species seems to be around 100-150 years, indicating that an extinction debt is likely to exist in recently isolated fragments. Only a few studies have addressed the ecological efficiency of the new, biodiversity-oriented forest management tools (retention trees, woodland key habitats). Despite this it seems that the traditional large conservation areas are the most effective means of polypore conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, determining which of these hypotheses underpins the ISAR in a given system remains an open and controversial question, particularly with regards to the environmental filtering. The effect of environmental filtering on the ISAR for woody plants was tested on 29 islands in a subtropical land-bridge archipelago. Island area had a significant effect on species richness, while isolation was not found to have an effect. After controlling for the passive sampling effect and habitat diversity using a systematic sampling design, we found that a positive ISAR remained. After controlling for island area and isolation, species richness was significantly affected by environmental conditions (e.g. total phosphorus, soil depth and bulk density). When a null model was used that randomly assigned individuals to islands from the regional pool, the difference between the observed and expected richness was greater for smaller islands relative to larger islands.

The objectives of this study were to examine the occurrence of remnant populations after abandonment of semi-natural grasslands and to examine functional traits of plants associated with the development of remnant populations. We surveyed six managed semi-natural grasslands and 20 former semi-natural grasslands where management ceased 60-100 years ago, and assessed species response to abandonment, assuming a space-for-time substitution. The response of species was related to nine traits representing life cycle, clonality, leaf traits, seed dispersal and seed mass. Of the 67 species for which data allowed analysis, 44 species declined after grassland abandonment but still occurred at the sites, probably as remnant populations. Five traits were associated with the response to abandonment. The declining but still occurring species were characterized by high plant height, a perennial life form, possession of a perennial bud bank, high clonal ability, and lack of dispersal attributes promoting long-distance dispersal. Traits allowing plants to maintain populations by utilizing only a part of their life cycle, such as clonal propagation, are most important for the capacity to develop remnant populations and delay local extinction. A considerable fraction of the species inhabiting semi-natural grasslands maintain what is most likely remnant populations after more than 60 years of spontaneous succession from managed semi-natural grasslands to forest.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER","2011 JUN","FOLIA GEOBOTANICA","46","2-3","165","179","10.1007/s12224-010-9071-8","1211-9520","WOS:000291042700005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Johansson, Veronika A. et al.

In some fragmented habitats, livestock grazing has been proposed to be a dispersal mechanism reducing isolation between fragments. In others, grazing acts together with fragmentation in a way that increases habitat degradation. Iberian gypsum plant communities have been grazed and fragmented by agricultural practices for centuries. Although their conservation is considered a priority by the European Community, the effects of fragmentation on gypsum plant communities and the possible role of livestock grazing remain unknown. In addition, a substantial proportion of plant species growing in gypsum environments are gypsum specialists. They could be particularly affected by fragmentation, as was found for other habitat specialists (i.e., serpentine and calcareous specialists). In this study (1) we investigated the effect of fragmentation and grazing on gypsum plant community composition (species and life-forms), and (2) we tested to see if gypsum specialists were differently affected by fragmentation and grazing than habitat generalists. A vegetation survey was conducted in the largest gypsum outcrop of Europe (Middle Ebro Valley, northeast Spain). Fragmented and continuous sites in grazed and ungrazed areas were compared. Measurements related to species and composition of life-forms were contrasted first for the whole gypsum plant community and then specifically for the gypsum specialists. In the whole community, our results showed lower plant species diversity in fragmented sites, mainly due to the larger dominance of species more tolerant to fragmented habitat conditions. With livestock grazing, the plant species richness and the similarity in plant species composition between remnants was larger, suggesting that animals were acting as dispersal agents between fragments. As expected, gypsum specialists were less abundant in fragmented areas, and grazing led to the disappearance of the rare gypsum specialist Campanula fastigiata. According to our results, conservation strategies for gypsum plant communities in human-dominated landscapes should consider that fragmentation and grazing modify plant community composition affecting gypsum specialists in particular.",NA,NA,"2008","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2008 JUN","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","18","4","954","964","10.1890/07-1770.1","1051-0761","WOS:000256243200012","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Pueyo, Y. et al.

It has been therefore proposed to classify forest plant species according to their affinity for ancient or recent patches. In this contribution, we aimed at providing a dynamical perspective on this static concept of ancient/recent forest species. We developed an inference method to estimate the metapopulation dynamics of forest plants based on landscape history and static (and incomplete) biodiversity data accounting for false absence records. We assessed the power of this novel inference method using simulated metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We finally applied this method to occupancy data of 174 and 121 forest species in two networks of 9208 and 9201 forest patches respectively. These patch networks are located in two French regions, with corresponding landscape historical data based on two forest maps conceived in 1840 and 2000. Our analyses revealed that i) the inference method enables to satisfactorily infer three parameters of the metapopulation model: the rates of colonization, extinction and decay of colonization with distance; ii) this three parameter metapopulation model is sufficient to reproduce the occurrence spatial structure of 72% and 61% of the investigated species in the two regions; iii) forest plant species are distributed along a spectrum of turn-over speed, in which small (large) colonization capacity are associated with small (large) propensity to extinction; iv) species position along this spectrum can be partially predicted from plant functional traits; and v) species metapopulation dynamics are driven by the interaction between landscape and species intrinsic properties, suggesting that ancient/recent forest species lists are unlikely to be easily extrapolated to novel landscapes.

B.","A metapopulation model for whale-fall specialists: The largest whales are essential to prevent species extinctions","The sunken carcasses of great whales (i.e., whale falls) provide an important deep-sea habitat for more than 100 species that may be considered whale-fall specialists. Commercial whaling has reduced the abundance and size of whales, and thus whale-fall habitats, as great whales were hunted and removed from the oceans, often to near extinction. In this article, we use a metapopulation modeling approach to explore the consequences of whaling to the abundance and persistence of whale-fall habitats in the deep sea and to the potential for extinction of whale-fall specialists. Our modeling indicates that the persistence of metapopulations of whale-fall specialists is linearly related to the abundance of whales, and extremely sensitive (to the fourth power) to the mean size of whales. Thus, whaling-induced declines in the mean size of whales are likely to have been as important as declines in whale abundance to extinction pressure on whale-fall specialists. Our modeling also indicates that commercial whaling, even under proposed sustainable yield scenarios, has the potential to yield substantial extinction of whale-fall specialists. The loss of whale-fall habitat is likely to have had the greatest impact on the diversity of whale-fall specialists in areas where whales have been hunted for centuries, allowing extinctions to proceed to completion. The North Atlantic experienced dramatic declines, and even extirpation, of many whale species before the 20th century; thus, extinctions of whale-fall specialists are likely to have already occurred in this region. Whale depletions have occurred more recently in the Southern Hemisphere and across most of the North Pacific; thus, these regions may still have substantial ""extinction debts,"" and many extant whale-fall specialists may be destined for extinction if whale populations do not recover in abundance and mean size over the next few decades. Prior to the resumption of commercial whaling, or the loosening of protections to reduce incidental take, the impacts of hunting on deep-sea whale-fall ecosystems, as well as differential protection of the largest whales within and across species, should be carefully considered.",NA,NA,"2019","SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH","2019 DEC","JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH","77",NA,"283","302",NA,"0022-2402 and 1543-9542","WOS:000518851400012","YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520-8109 USA","Article","NEW HAVEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Smith, Craig R. et al.

However, the capacity for vacant lot parcels to provide these benefits is influenced by current management practices and landscape legacies of urbanization, which typically results in degraded soil quality. The role of soil quality in supporting urban biodiversity and ecosystem functions is often overlooked when developing sustainable urban planning initiatives. This study investigated how soil physical and chemical properties influenced the community of urban spontaneous vegetation and soil invertebrates found within vacant lots mowed monthly or annually in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found that soil chemical and physical properties were strong predictors of soil-dwelling invertebrates, as vacant lots highly contaminated with heavy metals had simplified communities. Moreover, increased mowing frequency resulted in greater biomass and blooms of urban spontaneous forbs. Importantly, vacant lots dominated by urban spontaneous forbs and high bloom abundances also were contaminated with heavy metals, with implications for herbivores and pollinators using these resources. Our findings indicate that conservation initiatives must consider landscape legacies from industrial activity and local habitat management practices in order to support above and belowground habitat quality of greenspaces in urban ecosystems.

Consequently, there is an increasing need for governments to address the role of international trade in their strategies to prevent species introductions. However, many of the most problematic alien species are not recent arrivals but were introduced several decades ago. Hence, current patterns of alien-species richness may better reflect historical rather than contemporary human activities, a phenomenon which might be called ""invasion debt."" Here, we show that across 10 taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, terrestrial insects, and aquatic invertebrates) in 28 European countries, current numbers of alien species established in the wild are indeed more closely related to indicators of socioeconomic activity from the year 1900 than to those from 2000, although the majority of species introductions occurred during the second half of the 20th century. The strength of the historical signal varies among taxonomic groups, with those possessing good capabilities for dispersal (birds, insects) more strongly associated with recent socioeconomic drivers. Nevertheless, our results suggest a considerable historical legacy for the majority of the taxa analyzed. The consequences of the current high levels of socioeconomic activity on the extent of biological invasions will thus probably not be completely realized until several decades into the future.",NA,NA,"2011","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2011 JAN 4","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","108","1","203","207","10.1073/pnas.1011728108","0027-8424","WOS:000285915000040","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Essl, Franz et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Leroux, Anke D. and Creedy, John","Optimal land conversion and growth with uncertain biodiversity costs","The aim of this paper is to characterise the trade-offs between economic growth and natural resource conservation by determining the optimal rate of conversion of a natural reserve of land. Land conversion fuels consumption growth in the private sector, while simultaneously giving rise to uncertain environmental consequences, accounted for in terms of biodiversity benefits and modelled as non-linear stochastic processes. Random processes governing ecosystem dynamics and adaptation to anthropogenic change are important sources of prevailing ecological uncertainty and contribute to the problem of how to balance economic development against natural resource conservation. In a two-sector exogenous growth framework we model a stochastic environmental good, exhibiting uncertain ecological responses to environmental change, and describe the economic and environmental tradeoffs facing a risk-averse social planner. Allowing for ecological risk tends to slow economic growth if environmental impacts are assumed to increase exponentially as the rate of disturbance increases. Taken in isolation the effects of ecosystem resilience and ecological uncertainty on the rate of natural resource development are ambiguous and depend on normative parameters such as the social planner's attitude to risk and rate of time preference.

This paper investigates the legacies of European settlement of Noosa Shire, South-east Queensland, with particular emphasis on the economic and political drivers and the resultant loss and fragmentation of Koala Phascolarctos cinereus habitat. Patterns of habitat loss between 1860 and 1970 were quantified at a coarse level from historical and land tenure records, while changes over the past 30 years were mapped at a finer spatial resolution from aerial photography and satellite imagery. Periods of high economic growth and to lesser extents depression are linked to increased vegetation clearing. Fifty per cent of P. cinereus habitat has been lost since 1860, with habitat class 2A (30ltoreq50 per cent of preferred habitat trees) and 2C (10ltoreq30 per cent of preferred habitat trees) suffering the highest proportion of loss. The period of greatest habitat loss was between 1890 and 1910, linked to the development of the dairy industry in the western half of Noosa Shire. A second significant phase of loss occurred since 1970, linked to the planting of exotic pine plantations, urbanisation and rural subdivision, with 35 per cent of remaining habitat being cleared, mainly in the southern part of the Shire. The cumulative loss of habitat has been accompanied by increasing levels of habitat fragmentation indicated by reduced patch size and increased patch linearity. Further analysis of the temporal aspects of habitat change is required in order to test the hypothesis that there is a relaxation period between the timing of habitat loss and current pattern of habitat occupancy of P. cinereus populations.",NA,NA,"2003",NA,"2003","Australian Zoologist","32","3","446","461",NA,"0067-2238","BCI:BCI200400112476",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Seabrook, L.

In 2002 about one half of the study area was intensively managed for agricultural purposes, 19.3% was woodland and 14.4% was semi-natural grassland. The main vegetation gradient in the area reflected long-term management (land-use) intensity. Both species richness and habitat specificity decreased with increasing management intensity. Semi-natural grassland species occurred throughout the landscape, although with some concentration to semi-natural grasslands. The two measures of habitat specificity both peaked in semi-natural grasslands. Comparison of the present patterns of vascular plant distributions with information on past land-use derived from a map from 1865, indicate that species typical of semi-natural grasslands persist long after land use activities have come to an end and that there is an extinction debt in the vascular flora. The significant positive relationship between patches with high richness of species typical of semi-natural grasslands, remnant semi-natural grassland patches and man-made structures with long continuity, shows that restoring formerly open semi-natural grassland 'hot spots' in a agricultural landscapes is advantageous both for conservation of cultural and biological values.

Red-listed plants and fungi","We present the red-listed plants and fungi that have been found in the central parts of the parish of Stenbrohult. Here, Carl Linnaeus was born in 1707, and he spent his summers here until 1728. Of the II currently red-listed vascular plants that have been recorded since 1970 all occurred there also 300 years ago. Bryophytes, lichens and fungi have mainly been investigated during the last 15 years, but bryophytes still only in a small part of the study area. Three species of bryophytes, 51 of fungi and 26 of lichens that are red-listed in Sweden have been found in the area since 1970. These high numbers of red-listed fungi and lichens are surprising because the region has been assumed to be among the most species-poor in southern Sweden. The reasons for the high biodiversity in Stenbrohult are 1) many very old trees of southern deciduous tree species (mainly oak, beech and lime), 2) several remnants of southern deciduous forests with long-term tree continuity, 3) several unfertilized pastures and meadows with late harvest still maintained by grazing and mowing, 4) some forests and pastures with more calcium-rich soils than in the surrounding region, and 5) a large unpolluted lake (Mockeln) with a natural water regime. Threats to the long-term survival of the red-listed species are discussed. At least the following red-listed vascular plants have disappeared from the study area during the last 150 years: Tephroseris polustris, Crassula aquatica, Bromus secalinus, B. arvensis, Sherardia arvensis, Anthemis cotula, Agrostemma githago, and possibly Radiola linoides, and Lycopodiella inundata. The lichen Lobaria scrobiculata was collected at two sites in 1935 and 1942, Collema fasciculare before 1767 and Ramalina thrausta in 1935, but these red-listed lichen species are now locally extinct. The need for rapid habitat restoration to lower the ""extinction debt"" is stressed.

In this study we integrated several methods from landscape ecology and landscape genetics into a GIS-based analytical framework, and evaluated the impacts of development and forest restoration scenarios on landscape connectivity, population dynamics and genetic diversity of Sunda clouded leopard in the Malaysian state of Sabah. We also investigated the separate and interactive effects of changing mortality risk and connectivity. Our study suggested that the current clouded leopard population size is larger (+26%) than the current carrying capacity of the landscape due to time lag effects and extinction debt. Additionally, we predicted that proposed developments in Sabah may decrease landscape connectivity by 23% and, when including the increased mortality risk associated with these developments, result in a 40-63% decrease in population size and substantial reduction in genetic diversity. These negative impacts could be mitigated only to a very limited degree through extensive and targeted forest restoration. Our results suggest that realignment of roads and railways based on resistance to movement, without including mortality risk, might be misleading and may in some cases lead to decrease in population size. We therefore recommend that efforts to optimally plan road and railway locations base the optimization on effects of development on population size, density and distribution rather than solely on population connectivity.",NA,NA,"2019","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2019 JUL","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","235",NA,"63","76","10.1016/j.biocon.2019.04.001","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","WOS:000472696400006","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kaszta, Zaneta et al.

An interesting and important question is: who will be the first to become extinct in communities during habitat destruction, the inferior competitors or the superior competitors? Firstly, we demonstrate, by means of numerical simulation, an ""odds-even"" evolution rule: after extinction of a few dominant species following large habitat destruction, the rest of the community shows a spontaneous hierarchical self-organization, i.e., the species with either odd or even numbers become more abundant. Secondly, we show that for moderate or small habitat destruction, it is the poor competitor(s) that goes extinct first. Lastly, some ecological orders of persisting species of different metapopulation (community) during habitat destruction are ranged in the paper. These ecological orders of persisting species show that there exists a special ecological position in different metapopulation system (community) in which the species will evolve into the strongest (best) competitor during habitat destruction.

Its influence in laboratory experimental systems has however been questioned. In fact, other factors involved in long-term population persistence, like habitat size, were usually found to explain most of the dynamics of experimental populations. To better understand the respective influence of short- and long-term factors and their potential interaction on extinction dynamics in experimental systems, we investigated the influence of propagule pressure, habitat size and genetic background on the early dynamics of laboratory-based populations of a hymenopteran parasitoid. The amount of demographic variance differed between establishment and persistence phase and was influenced by habitat size and genetic background (geographic strain), but independent of propagule pressure. In contrast, the probability of extinction within five generations depended on the genetic background and on the interaction between propagule pressure and habitat size. Vulnerability to extinction in small size habitats was increased when populations were founded with a small number of individuals, but this effect was delayed until the third to fifth generations. These results indicate that demographic stochasticity is influential during population establishment, but is not affected by the genetic variability of propagules. On the other hand, extinction might be influenced by a genetic Allee effect triggered by the combination of low propagule pressure and genetic drift. Finally, we documented consistent differences between genetic backgrounds in both deterministic and stochastic population dynamics patterns, with major consequences on extinction risk and ultimately population establishment.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 MAY","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","82","3","621","631","10.1111/1365-2656.12051","0021-8790 and 1365-2656","WOS:000317863400013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Vercken, Elodie et al.

The generality of these assumptions is questioned. Of particular concern are the assumptions that good competitors are poor dispersers, and that good competitors are the most abundant species. Furthermore, we suggest that the spatial scale of metapopulation dynamics in the model may not be appropriate for representing impacts of habitat destrustion.

Biotic homogenization (BH), a dominant process shaping the response of natural communities to human disturbance, reflects both the expansion of exotic species at large scales and other mechanisms that often operate at smaller scales.2. Here, we examined the relationship between BH in plant communities and spatio-temporal landscape disturbance (habitat fragmentation and surrounding habitat conversion) at a local scale (1 km(2)), using data from a standardized monitoring programme in France. We quantified BH using both a spatial partitioning of taxonomic diversity and the average habitat specialization of communities, which informs on functional BH.3. We observed a positive relationship between local taxonomic diversity and landscape fragmentation or instability. This increase in local taxonomic diversity was, however, paralleled by a decrease in average community specialization in more fragmented landscapes and in more unstable landscapes around forest sites. The decrease in average community specialization suggests that landscape disturbance causes functional BH, but there was limited evidence for concurrent taxonomic BH.4. Synthesis. Our results show that landscape disturbance is partly responsible for functional BH at small scales via the extirpation of specialist species, with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, this change in community composition is not systematically associated with taxonomic BH. This has direct relevance in designing biodiversity indicators: metrics incorporating species sensitivity to disturbance (such as species specialization to habitat) appear much more reliable than taxonomic diversity for documenting the response of communities to disturbance.",NA,NA,"2011","WILEY","2011 SEP","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","99","5","1134","1142","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01851.x","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000294013800006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Abadie, Jean-Claude et al.

Unprecedented anthropogenic activities are the main drivers, with habitat loss due to land transformation and unsustainable use being the most important factors. These anthropogenic activities are not just a contemporary phenomenon, but also have a long history, and their historical dynamics may shape distributions of threatened plants. However, the relative roles of historical and current changes in anthropogenic activities in determining the distribution of threatened plant species across large geographic regions have hitherto been rarely studied. In this study, for the first time, we linked the distribution of threatened species across China to current and historical changes in human population densities, cropland area, and pasture area since 1700 (at a 100 km x 100 km resolution). We find that variables describing historical changes in human impacts were consistently more strongly associated with proportions of threatened plants than variables describing current changes in human impacts. Notably, threatened plant species in China tend to be concentrated where historical anthropogenic impacts were relatively small, but anthropogenic activities have intensified relatively strongly since 1700. Hence, threatened species are likely to be concentrated in areas that have only recently come under anthropogenic pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To accomplish this, we compared bird richness and functional group structure of two small forest fragments (<250 ha) with adjacent recently reforested areas (9 and 7 years of reforestation). Reforested areas had equal or higher bird richness and similar functional group structure. These results indicate that reforested areas are capable of maintaining current levels of biodiversity and reducing species extinction debt in small forest fragments, which is the main purpose of ""Restoration Reserves"". However, when we compared a large forest fragment with an old adjacent reforested area (20 years of reforestation), we found that it was of limited value for certain functional groups.

"CHAP",NA,"Gilbert, Benjamin and O'Connor, Mary I.","Climate change and species interactions: beyond local communities","It is increasingly recognized that the wide-scale modification of habitats caused by climate change requires scientists to consider how species and species interactions change both locally and at larger, regional scales. Metacommunity approaches explicitly link local and regional dynamics for communities of species, providing a conceptual and mathematical framework for global change biologists. These approaches can scale between community-level impacts and the regional distributions and movements of species, and likewise determine how changes to regional processes, such as dispersal and habitat configuration, influence local abundances and occurrences. This review discusses several lessons that have recently emerged from climate change studies and metacommunity theory to identify some of the key processes that link local-scale studies to regional-scale properties of communities, and vice versa. We then use simple models to highlight how these linkages function and to identify where research could gain most by studying specific local and regional processes. Finally, we propose methods for the field to move forward by clarifying how to incorporate metacommunity approaches into empirical research, and by identifying important gaps in metacommunity research.",NA,NA,"2013","BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL","2013","CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS: WAYS FORWARD","1297",NA,"98","111","10.1111/nyas.12149","0077-8923 and *****************","WOS:000324840700008","OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND","Article and Book Chapter","OXFORD",NA,NA,"Angert, AL and LaDeau, SL and Ostfeld, RS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gilbert, Benjamin et al.

The resulting transient dynamics are complex and may cause overoptimistic biodiversity assessments. We propose a simple budget framework to integrate climatic debt with two classes of intervention: (i) climatic credits that pay some of the debt, reducing the overall biological change required to reach a new equilibrium; and (ii) options to adjust the debt repayment rate, either making a system more responsive by increasing the rate or temporarily reducing the rate to buy more time for local adaptation and credit implementation.

Scientific literature on wildfire and ES is growing rapidly, but connections are disparate and evolving.ObjectivesWe review relationships between mountain wildfire and a comprehensive list of 50 relevant ES informed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Our conceptual framework is used to evaluate underlying mechanisms and the direction and scale of wildfire impacts on ES.MethodsWe focus the review on the Colorado Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, one of the best-studied landscapes in the world for understanding fire-ES relationships and evaluating how regional differences contribute to broader understanding of ES globally. We begin our review by considering key relationships, followed by a structured literature search of wildfire impacts with tabulated trends and findings.ResultsKey findings from the review: (1) current fire regimes mostly have negative impacts on ES, with some positive effects on cultural services, (2) changes to vegetation composition and structure are the most common mechanism, (3) mechanisms acting at local and landscape scales impact ES at broader scales, (4) intermediate services warrant attention and management resources, and (5) regional differences may provide opportunities for stronger global synthesis.ConclusionsFamiliarity with landscape legacies, current land use practices, and stakeholder values uniquely positions landscape ecologists to contribute to future studies of wildfire-ES connections.

This idea has recently been challenged, with increasing evidence that plant community assembly can only be considered deterministic at the plant trait level, rather than at the species level, and that the assembly outcome is largely influenced by the spatial context of the restoration site. We surveyed 147 vegetation plots across a chronosequence of 22 restored semi-natural grassland patches to quantify the effects of spatial isolation on both plant species and plant trait assembly. Trait level assembly was analysed using an emergent group approach, based on 28 functional plant traits. Additionally, we examined the effects of several dispersal-related plant traits on species recolonization capacities. Whereas total plant species richness of the restoration patches did not change through space or through time, progressing assembly was found to consist of a sequential replacement of generalist species with specialist species, which was reflected by a directional assembly at the plant trait level. Grassland isolation was found to slow down community assembly at both the species and the trait level without changing the general direction of assembly. This slowdown became less pronounced with increasing time since restoration. Spatial isolation of the restoration patches was found to act as a trait filter, independent of assembly age. We found a proportionally higher occurrence of species with light seeds and a high seed attachment potential in more isolated restoration patches, suggesting that colonization is more limited in isolated grasslands. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the assembly process, at both the species and the trait level, is influenced by the position of the restoration patch in the landscape. Monitoring schemes following ecological restoration should therefore include the spatial context of the system while using both a trait-based and a species-based plant community analysis. Successful restoration requires physically interconnecting grassland fragments and probably the introduction of seeds or seedlings of species with low dispersability.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 APR","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","50","2","404","413","10.1111/1365-2664.12037","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000316969300014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Helsen, Kenny et al.

Numerous studies have explored the relationship between contemporary human activities and different biodiversity metrics, but the influence of past activities, such as land-use, remains poorly understood despite being one of the oldest human impacts. Here we evaluate the role of past land-use modifications in the current distribution and conservation status of mammals worldwide using spatial data characterizing human land use from ca BC 6000 to ca AD 2000. First, we applied a clustering method that revealed three generalized past human land-use trajectories that represent low-, recently- and steadily-used areas widely represented across the globe. Second, we fitted boosted regression trees to predict total and threatened mammalian richness, globally and within trajectory-clusters, testing the role of environmental factors and multiple human land-use metrics reflecting: total used area at different time spans, rates of land-use change, and the occurrence of remarkable land-use shifts. Environmental factors were identified as the main correlates of current mammalian richness, but several proposed metrics of past land-use were also relevant predictors. Overall, these results highlight the likely existence of a land-use legacy in some regions of the world that has influenced the distribution of extant mammals, particularly of those currently classified as threatened. Even if we cannot change that legacy, our results show that we need to account for past human impacts to understand present biodiversity patterns and, arguably, to guide future actions.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 OCT","ECOGRAPHY","42","10","1623","1635","10.1111/ecog.04406","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000485028100001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Polaina, Ester et al.

However, defining the realized niche of a species is problematic due to variation across spatial and temporal scales. In this study we tested the hypothesis that habitat parameters defining the realized niche of a species can be derived from a regional study and that national changes in land use influence the perception of the realized niche across different landscapes. We described the realized habitat niche of the threatened dragonfly Leucorrhinia pectoralis, in four Estonian landscapes which all have undergone more than 20 years of habitat degradations. We recorded the presence/absence of L. pectoralis and measured 7 habitat variables for 140 lakes and ponds located in one restored and three un-restored landscapes. Lake size and proportion of short riparian vegetation were significantly positive parameters determining the presence of L. pectoralis across landscape types. The species was much more habitat specific in the restored landscape, with larger influence of other habitat parameters. Our data suggest that the realized niche of the species in the un-restored landscapes was constrained by the present-day habitats. The study demonstrate that if a species realized niche is derived from local distribution patterns without incorporating landscape history it can lead to an erroneous niche definition. We show that landscape restoration can provide knowledge on a species' habitat dependencies before habitat degradation has occurred, provided that restoration mitigation reflects the former landscape characteristics.",NA,NA,"2016","SPRINGER JAPAN KK","2016 JAN","POPULATION ECOLOGY","58","1","155","164","10.1007/s10144-015-0516-z","1438-3896 and 1438-390X","WOS:000367807500014","CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN","Article","TOKYO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Iversen, Lars Lonsmann et al.

The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 JUN","NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY","37","6",NA,NA,"10.1111/njb.02175","0107-055X and 1756-1051","WOS:000473066300003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lampinen, Jussi (2019) Disturbance, Microclimate and Historical Habitat Connectivity Determine the Population Performance of the Threatened Grassland Specialist Carex Caryophyllea in Remnant Grasslands. <i>Jour</i>.

Immediately after habitat loss, species occurrences are not in equilibrium with the new landscape and more closely reflect the previous landscape structure. Species with slow colonisation-extinction dynamics may display long time-lags before reaching a new equilibrium. We investigated the importance of connectivity to current and historical dispersal sources with the aim of explaining the occurrence pattern of epiphytic lichens with different traits among 104 old oaks. We used oak survey data collected from 1830 and 2009 for a Swedish landscape where oak densities declined drastically shortly after 1830. We fitted a commonly used connectivity measure and estimated the confidence interval for the spatial scale parameter. Small differences in the spatial scale parameter resulted in large differences in model fit. Connectivity to trees in 1830 better explained the occurrence of three of the four species compared to the connectivity in 2009. The explanatory power of the historical landscape structure was highest for the species with traits that may result in a low colonisation rate-both a narrow niche (here few suitable trees) and large dispersal propagules. The results suggest that oak-dependent epiphytic lichens have not reached equilibrium with the spatial landscape structure 180 years after the drastic decline in habitat. For the long-term persistence of epiphytes associated with old trees, conservation efforts should focus on (1) protecting and restoring stands where specialised species with large dispersal propagules (i.e. with low colonisation rates) occur today and (2) promoting tree regeneration in their near vicinity.",NA,NA,"2013","SPRINGER","2013 JUN","OECOLOGIA","172","2","607","615","10.1007/s00442-012-2509-3","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000319077100029","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Johansson, Victor et al.

A prominent example of such a species is the European bison (Bison bonasus), occurring only in small, isolated herds, and whose survival will depend on establishing larger, well-connected populations. Our goal here was to assess habitat connectivity of European bison in the Carpathians. We used an existing bison habitat suitability map and data on dispersal barriers to derive cost surfaces, representing the ability of bison to move across the landscape, and to delineate potential connections (as least-cost paths) between currently occupied and potential habitat patches. Graph theory tools were then employed to evaluate the connectivity of all potential habitat patches and their relative importance in the network. Our analysis showed that existing bison herds in Ukraine are isolated. However, we identified several groups of well-connected habitat patches in the Carpathians which could host a large population of European bison. Our analysis also located important dispersal corridors connecting existing herds, and several promising locations for future reintroductions (especially in the Eastern Carpathians) that should have a high priority for conservation efforts. In general, our approach indicates the most important elements within a landscape mosaic for providing and maintaining the overall connectivity of different habitat networks and thus offers a robust and powerful tool for conservation planning.

Recently, the use of dynamic models is increasingly advocated for because these models better represent the main processes involved in range shifts and also simulate transient dynamics. A well-known problem with the application of these models is the lack of data for estimating necessary parameters of demographic and dispersal processes. However, what has been hardly considered so far is the fact that simulating transient dynamics potentially implies additional uncertainty arising from our ignorance of short-term climate variability in future climatic trends. Here, we use endemic mountain plants of Austria as a case study to assess how the integration of decadal variability in future climate affects outcomes of dynamic range models as compared to projected long-term trends and uncertainty in demographic and dispersal parameters. We do so by contrasting simulations of a so-called hybrid model run under fluctuating climatic conditions with those based on a linear interpolation of climatic conditions between current values and those predicted for the end of the 21st century. We find that accounting for short-term climate variability modifies model results nearly as differences in projected long-term trends and much more than uncertainty in demographic/dispersal parameters. In particular, range loss and extinction rates are much higher when simulations are run under fluctuating conditions. These results highlight the importance of considering the appropriate temporal resolution when parameterizing and applying range-dynamic models, and hybrid models in particular. In case of our endemic mountain plants, we hypothesize that smoothed linear time series deliver more reliable results because these long-lived species are primarily responsive to long-term climate averages.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 JUL","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","22","7","2608","2619","10.1111/gcb.13232","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000378722000026","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Huelber, Karl et al.

We evaluated the relative effects of habitat fragmentation and local environmental conditions on population structure and reproductive performance of the long-lived corm geophyte Colchicum autumnale in 17 highly fragmented populations. Habitat isolation did not affect patch occupancy, population structure or plant performance. in contrast, population size and local environment strongly affected population structure and reproductive performance. Densities of all life stages increased with increasing population size. Large populations also showed a higher reproductive performance and a larger proportion of new recruits. Relationships with local growth conditions pointed towards the importance of an open grassland sward for flower and fruit set and the presence of microsites for successful sexual recruitment. These results suggest that the distribution of C. autumnale consists of an assemblage of basically unconnected populations that are remnants of formerly larger populations. This is in accordance with the species' ability to grow clonally, allowing long-term persistence under deteriorating conditions that occurred during a long period of habitat fragmentation. In conclusion, our results indicate that local habitat and population size are more important than habitat fragmentation (i.e. calcareous grassland isolation and surface area) and argue in favour of a management that is primarily focused on local habitat restoration. This is preferentially accomplished by reintroducing grazing practices, complemented by regular setback of spontaneous succession towards forest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Little is known how the surrounding landscape and landscape history influence these patterns. I analysed how plant species richness was affected by isolation, habitat area, past and present land use, and if landscape context matters. Plant species occurrence in two different types of small marginal habitats were analysed, road verges and midfield islets. The study was conducted in two different agricultural landscapes in Sweden; one open modern agricultural landscape and one traditional rural landscape, and the results compared. Present and past land use, and landscape change was analysed using aerial photographs and old maps. There was a large grassland reduction more than 50 years ago in the modern landscape, when there still were quite a lot of grasslands left in the traditional landscape. Area and connectivity were more important for plant incidence in small remnant habitats in the modem landscape, compared to the less fragmented, traditional rural landscape. On the other hand there were more grassland specialists, 23% in the traditional landscape compared to 16%. Species richness became higher on midfield islet if grazing was re-introduced. The legacy of surrounding landscape remains in the species pool for a long time, at least 50 years, even in small grassland fragments. Although small grassland remnants are more sensitive to fragmentation effects compared to larger grasslands, they still encompass a substantial part of the grassland species pool and may be valuable for reconstructing grassland management at a landscape scale.

Even in a relatively short time interval and a small local region with relatively homogeneous biophysical interference, forest cover may be changed considerably by human disturbances. To better understand human influences on the pattern of forest cover change (FCC), we investigated the factors of FCC from 2007 to 2012 by combining the broad socio-economic information at the census block group level with the site-specific information measured at the pixel level. Taking the upstream area of the Minjiang River, China, as a case study, the result indicated that the major forest cover classes had a high rate of persistence in area size during the study period, while conversions among forest covers and into non-forest land occurred frequently, accounting for 5.4% of the landscape. The change of mixed forest was among the greatest one, decreasing sharply from 24.0% to 21.6% of the entire landscape, which converted predominantly into coniferous forest from 2007 to 2012. Additionally, 90.0% of the net gain to non-forest land was largely supplied by coniferous forest and mixed forest. The findings corroborate that human-driven conversions of forest covers have deleterious effects on biodiversity conservation in the upstream area of the Minjiang River. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression model was used to observe the biophysical/socio-economic drivers of FCC. We identified a FCC pattern during the period of study that was associated with collective- or enterprise-owned forests, low level of protection intensity forests, and the regions with high growth rates of fiscal revenue and far away from the city center. These results confirm that as a whole the relevant governments play an important role in the FCC in the region. This study is important for the relevant policy-makers and planners to better understand the underlying patterns and causes of this landscape change, to develop effective strategies for conserving biodiversity.

"JOUR",NA,"Johansson, Victor and Ranius, Thomas and Snall, Tord","Epiphyte metapopulation persistence after drastic habitat decline and low tree regeneration: time-lags and effects of conservation actions","Old trees have declined in Europe due to agricultural intensification and forestry. For shade-intolerant epiphytic species occurring on old trees in semi-open landscapes, host tree numbers have further decreased because of shading by developing secondary woodland. Moreover, in this habitat, regeneration that could replace the extant old trees is low. This suggests that epiphytic species associated with old trees are declining. However, for species with low extinction rates, the decline may be slow and hard to elucidate. We investigated the persistence of five old-oak-associated epiphytic lichens with different traits by simulating metapopulation dynamics using Bayesian incidence function models for dynamic landscapes. With an oak-rich landscape as a reference, we investigated effects of (i) drastic habitat decline, (ii) conservation actions such as clearing around trees or increased regeneration rate, (iii) low tree regeneration and (iv) clearing and increased regeneration after 100years of low regeneration. After drastic habitat decline, the number of occupied trees continued to decrease, displaying long time-lags before reaching new metapopulation equilibriums. Lichen extinction risks increased with decreasing habitat and were highest for species that only colonise very old trees or have large dispersal propagules. In landscapes with low tree densities, conservation actions had only minor effects on lichen extinction risks. Low tree regeneration rates increased lichen extinction risks, but species declines were slow. Conservation actions that increased regeneration after 100years of low regeneration decreased the extinction risks to very low levels. Synthesis and applications. Due to low rates of local extinction, epiphytes display long time-lags to reach new equilibriums after habitat loss. Thus, we should expect ongoing declines in epiphyte metapopulations in landscapes where old trees have recently declined. Slow extinction gives an opportunity to improve persistence by conservation actions, but the success depends on species traits and the current density of old trees. In landscapes with many old but few young trees, epiphytes may persist if conservation actions quickly address the need to increase tree regeneration rates. The best conservation approach for long-term persistence of epiphytic lichens is to ensure regular tree regeneration in landscapes with a current high density of old trees.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 APR","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","50","2","414","422","10.1111/1365-2664.12049","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000316969300015","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Johansson, Victor et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Raum, Susanne","Land-use legacies of twentieth-century forestry in the UK: a perspective","Context Complex interactions between societies and their environment have shaped landscapes across Europe over centuries. Therefore, taking a historical perspective can be important when designing new forestry policy and management activities. Objectives This perspective aims to improve our appreciation of how a better historical understanding of landscapes can increase our understanding of current conditions and inform current and future policy and practice. I provide a perspective on land-use legacies and forest change, with a particular emphasis on landscapes, and using the example of forestry in the United Kingdom. Methods For this purpose, I undertook a comprehensive review of scholarly forestry literature and of relevant policy and legal documents in the UK, covering the last 100 years. Results This brief review of the dynamics of forest landscapes in the UK over the last 100 years, shows that certain decisions, policies and management activities had major effects on the landscape, especially in terms of landscape patterns and species distribution, constraining it until today. Historic research investigated some of these legacies, leading to real change in policy and management, including a Broadleaved Policy, an Ancient Woodland Inventory, habitat restoration, habitat network and rewilding schemes. Research on past experiences of Dutch Elm disease in the UK and of similar outbreaks in other countries have guided responses to today's tree pest/disease outbreaks and plant trade decisions. Conclusion A better appreciation of past decisions and activities, especially in forestry, helps to anticipate landscape legacy effects and potential cross-scale interactions of new policies and practices. It may also help to better justify and negotiate new decisions and long-term planning among multiple actors.",NA,NA,"2020","SPRINGER","2020 DEC","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","35","12","2713","2722","10.1007/s10980-020-01126-1","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000572833500001","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Raum, Susanne (2020) Land-Use Legacies of Twentieth-Century Forestry in the Uk: a Perspective. <i>Jour</i>.

Comprehensive assessments of insect declines must account for both detected and undetected species. We studied extirpations among butterflies, a particularly well-known insect group, in the highly developed and biologically well-surveyed island city-state of Singapore. Building on existing butterfly species lists, we collated museum and naturalist records over the last two centuries and used statistical models to estimate the total extirpation rate since the first major collections in 1854. In addition, we compiled a set of traits for each butterfly species and explored how they relate to species discovery and extirpation. With a database of 413 native species, 132 (32%) of which are recorded as extirpated in Singapore, we used a statistical model to infer that, in addition, 104 unknown species (95% CI 60-162) were likely extirpated before they were ever discovered, suggesting a total extirpation rate of 46% (41-51%). In the trait analyses, we found that butterfly species that were discovered later were weakly associated with rarer larval host plants and smaller wingspans, while species that persisted for longer were weakly associated with higher larval host plant abundance and lower forest-dependence. This exercise is one of the first to offer a holistic estimate of extirpations for a group of insects by accounting for undetected extirpations. It suggests that extirpations among insects, specifically in the tropics, may be higher than naive estimates based only on known records.",NA,NA,"2020","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2020 FEB","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","242",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108401","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","WOS:000517855100006","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Theng, Meryl et al.

However, in human-dominated landscapes such as cities, conservation reserve systems are, by necessity, often determined without using conservation planning principles. This can result in reserve systems that are small, fragmented and disconnected. In this study, we conducted a floristic survey of 68 urban grassland conservation reserves to assess how reserves of different areas contribute to species conservation. Species accumulation curves, species-area relationships, and proportion of native cover were explored. We found that 87% of all native plant species were found in small reserves < 10 ha in size, more small reserves contained a greater number of species than few large reserves of a comparable area, and cover of native species in small reserves was no different than cover in large reserves. However, large reserves harboured more uncommon species than smaller reserves. This research has several important implications for conservation planning and design, highlighting that both small and large reserves can help to conserve native plant species in urban areas. However, a preference for large reserves over small ones is embedded in much conservation planning and management. There is a danger that a normative belief that large reserves are 'good' and small reserves are 'bad' has become entrenched in conservation thinking. While the theory and evidence showing the conservation benefits of large reserves over small reserves for some organisms is clear, in some cases, small reserves can make a substantial and genuine contribution to conservation outcomes.",NA,NA,"2017","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2017 SEP","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","213",NA,"146","153","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.07.007","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","WOS:000410014100017","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Article","OXFORD",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kendal, Dave et al.

Recently, the ability of established approaches to identify reliably the differential effects of landscape structure (e. g. land-cover composition, remnant vegetation configuration and extent) on the mobility of organisms has been questioned. More explicit methods of predicting and testing for such effects must move beyond post hoc explanations for single landscapes and species. Here, we document a process for making a priori predictions, using existing spatial and ecological data and expert opinion, of the effects of landscape structure on genetic structure of multiple species across replicated landscape blocks. We compare the results of two common methods for estimating the influence of landscape structure on effective distance: least-cost path analysis and isolation-by-resistance. We present a series of alternative models of genetic connectivity in the study area, represented by different landscape resistance surfaces for calculating effective distance, and identify appropriate null models. The process is applied to ten species of sympatric woodland-dependant birds. For each species, we rank a priori the expectation of fit of genetic response to the models according to the expected response of birds to loss of structural connectivity and landscape-scale tree-cover. These rankings (our hypotheses) are presented for testing with empirical genetic data in a subsequent contribution.

We collated trait data for spiders and beetles and used a functional diversity index (FRic) to test for nonrandomness in the contribution of endemic, other native (also combined as indigenous), and exotic species to functional-trait space across the nine islands of the Azores. In general, for both taxa and for each distributional category, functional diversity increases with species richness, which, in turn scales with island area. Null simulations support the hypothesis that each distributional group contributes to functional diversity in proportion to their species richness. Exotic spiders have added novel trait space to a greater degree than have exotic beetles, likely indicating greater impact of the reduction of immigration filters and/or differential historical losses of indigenous species. Analyses of species occurring in native-forest remnants provide limited indications of the operation of habitat filtering of exotics for three islands, but only for beetles. Although the general linear (not saturating) pattern of trait-space increase with richness of exotics suggests an ongoing process of functional enrichment and accommodation, further work is urgently needed to determine how estimates of extinction debt of indigenous species should be adjusted in the light of these findings.",NA,NA,"2014","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2014 SEP 23","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","111","38","13709","13714","10.1073/pnas.1218036111","0027-8424","WOS:000341988200024","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Whittaker, Robert J. et al.

To improve habitat quality on clearcuts, green tree and dead wood retention is widely applied in forestry; however, its effects on rare early-successional species have rarely been shown. We repeatedly surveyed two red-listed beetle species (Upis ceramboides and Platysoma minus) on clearcuts in a managed boreal forest landscape. We found that U. ceramboides decreased its occupancy over time while P. minus increased, indicating that red-listed species vary in their ability to successfully utilise managed habitats. We found no effect of connectivity on probability of occurrence, colonisation or extinction per clearcut. Trees retained alive improved habitat quality of clearcuts, since both species were more frequent in dead wood of such trees, in comparison to logging residues. We suggest that retention can be improved by protecting and creating dead wood as intact trees during harvesting. Rare specialist species require habitat of high quality, and consequently it is impossible to meet the requirements of these species on every clearcut. To preserve all early-successional species at a regional scale, we recommend focusing retention of green trees and dead wood to one or a few trees species on each clearcut and in each landscape.",NA,NA,"2014","SPRINGER","2014 FEB","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","23","2","449","466","10.1007/s10531-013-0612-3","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000329990300012","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rubene, Diana et al.

It is less clear at which spatial and temporal scales these adverse changes are taking place, and more information is needed to reliably predict which species are especially sensitive to loss and fragmentation of habitat. Here we compare species richness, incidence of occurrence in forest fragments, and abundance of polyporous fungal species and species groups between two regions in Finland with contrasting histories of forestry and a marked difference in the amount and spatial configuration of old-growth forests. We also analyse the consequences of increasing loss of connectivity on the presence and abundance of polypores in a study region with a documented short-term history of old-growth fragmentation. Our results show that the species number, incidence of occurrence, and abundance of especially the rare, threatened, and near-threatened species are much lower in the old-growth fragments in Hame in southern Finland in comparison with Kuhmo in eastern Finland, most probably because of the longer history of intensive forestry in Hame. Among the rare species, the species that show the greatest difference between the two regions (at the scale of 500 km) also tended to respond most strongly to the more recent forest fragmentation within the study region in Kuhmo (at the scale of 50 km).

Their decline may hence lead to serious ecological and economic impacts, making it essential to understand the processes that drive pollinator shifts in space and time. Land-use changes are thought to be one of the most important drivers of pollinators' loss, and there is increasing investment on pollinator-friendly landscape management. However, it is still unclear whether landscape history of a given region determines how pollinator communities respond to further landscape modification.LocationThe Netherlands.MethodsUsing geographically explicit historical landscape and pollinator data from the Netherlands, we evaluated how species richness changes of three important pollinator groups (bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are affected by landscape changes related to habitat composition, fragmentation and species spillover potential and whether such effects depend on the historical characteristics of the landscape.ResultsThe effect of landscape changes varied between different pollinator groups. While bumblebee richness benefited from increases in edges between managed and natural systems, other bees benefited from increases in landscape heterogeneity and hoverfly richness was fairly resistant to land-use changes. We found that for the majority of the pollinators past landscape characteristics conditioned, the more recent pollinator richness changes. Landscapes that historically had more suitable habitat were more susceptible to display hoverfly declines (caused by drivers not considered in this study). Landscapes that historically had greater spillover potential were more likely to suffer butterfly richness declines and the bumblebee assemblages were more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.Main conclusionsThe diversity of responses of the pollinator groups suggest that multispecies approaches that take group-specific responses to land-use change into account are highly valuable. These findings emphasize the limited value of a one-size-fits-all biodiversity conservation measure and highlight the importance of considering landscape history when planning biodiversity conservation actions.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY","2015 OCT","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","21","10","1129","1140","10.1111/ddi.12350","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000361204100001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus et al.

'Ancient forest species' (AFS, i.e. a group of forest vascular plant species that rely on forest continuity) were previously noted as possible indicators of biodiversity hotspots. However, different aspects of the forest continuity may be important for different taxa. Using data from two multi-taxa surveys of central European forests, we examined spatial congruence between the richness of AFS and other forest-dwelling groups in stands that differed in various aspects of forest continuity. We provide evidence for a general positive relationship between the richness of AFS and other forest-dwelling taxa (bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, beetles, moths and some groups of edaphic organisms) in temperate European forests. The ability of AFS to indicate hotspots of forest biodiversity is not seriously affected by forest management even in the case of long-term intensive and specific management practices such as coppicing. Any easily observable characteristics of the forest environment, excepting the richness of AFS, are unlikely to track exactly the complex effects of forest continuity, habitat quality and the delay in the rise and fall of species diversity of forest communities. Some other perennial plant species associated with beech forests are similar to AFS and regularly occupied the refuges of threatened species. The stands with outstanding biodiversity within the area of deciduous temperate forests can be easily revealed via AFS richness and eventually other similar beech-associated species in the case of beech forests. The retention of all small, mutually isolated refuges of endangered species interspersed within large areas of managed forests may be crucial for the mitigation of biodiversity decline in temperate European forests.",NA,NA,"2019","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","2019 JUN","ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS","101",NA,"904","912","10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.018","1470-160X and 1872-7034","WOS:000470963300090","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hofmeister, Jenyk et al.

The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition and forest adaptive capacity. In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long-term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose 'regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. Using U.S. Forest Service-Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid-Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance and land use) were associated with both low-regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease-prone and/or suboptimal species. Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid-Atlantic region will likely lead to long-term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest-dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration.

Some researchers have suggested that places with high species diversity in cities simply reflect an extinction debt of populations that are doomed to extinction but have not yet disappeared. The longitudinal studies conducted to date have found species composition shifting with urbanization but have not always documented continued species extirpations post-urbanization. We used long-term monitoring data on birds from the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona, to measure changes in residential bird communities, species-habitat relationships, and human perceptions of bird species diversity over a five-year period. Bird richness, occupancy, and abundance decreased, as did the percentage of respondents satisfied with bird variety in their neighborhoods. As in previous analyses for this region, we found that desert specialist species were associated with neighborhoods with xeric landscaping consisting of gravel groundcover, and drought-tolerant, desert-adapted vegetation. These species were also found in neighborhoods with high per capita income rates and lower percentages of renters and I Iispanic/Latinx residents. Non-native species were positively associated with neighborhoods containing mesic yards with grass and other water-intensive vegetation. The proportions of yards in our surveyed neighborhoods with these distinct landscaping types likewise remained relatively stable over five-year period. Although habitat-species relationships remained unchanged, we detected significant loss of species across the sampling period. Declines were not confined to desert specialist species but included generalist and invader species as well. The parallel reduction in residents' satisfaction suggests that people perceive some aspect of this environmental degradation. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these species losses may reveal options for retaining some desert specialist species, and the uniqueness they contribute to urban fauna.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 MAR","ECOSPHERE","10","3",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2624","2150-8925","WOS:000463977000013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Warren, Paige S. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Cordonnier, Thomas and Courbaud, Benoit and Franc, Alain","The effect of colonization and competition processes on the relation between disturbance and diversity in plant communities","Many theoretical and field studies have emphasized the impact of disturbance in the dynamics and diversity of sessile organism communities. This view is best reflected by the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which states that a maximum of diversity is found in ecosystems or communities experiencing intermediate disturbance regimes or at an intermediate stage of development since the last major disturbance event. Although theoretical models based on competitive interactions tend to validate this hypothesis, a recent meta-analysis of field experiments revealed that the mono-modal relationship between disturbance and diversity might not be a general pattern. In this article, we investigate the relationship between disturbance and diversity through the study of patch models, combining two types of competitive interactions: with or without competitive hierarchy, with two mechanisms influencing colonization: negative frequency dependence in colonization rates and immigration. These combinations led to various disturbance-diversity patterns. In the model without competitive hierarchy (founder effect model), a decreasing relationship appeared to be the rule as mentioned in previous studies. In the model with competitive hierarchy, the IDH pattern was obtained for low frequency dependence and low immigration. Nevertheless, high negative frequency dependence in colonization rates led to a decreasing relationship between disturbance and diversity. In contrast, high immigration led to an increasing relationship. The coexistence window (the range of disturbance intensity allowing coexistence) was the widest for intermediate immigration rates. For random species assemblages, patterns with multiple peaks were also possible. These results highlight the fact that the mono-modal IDH pattern should not be considered a rule. Competition and colonization mechanisms have a profound impact on the relationship between disturbance and diversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Presence/absence was established for potentially suitable habitat patches (n = 158) on calcareous moist grassland and analyzed in a multiple logistic regression model where patch area, patch isolation and nine habitat quality variables were included as explanatory variables. Larval food plant density was positively, and patch isolation negatively, correlated to the presence of Euphydryas aurinia. Area did not contribute to the explanation of the occurrence pattern. Significant interactions between larval food plant density times patch isolation, and larval food plant density times vegetation height, show that with low food plant density the butterfly primarily occurs in patches with a vegetation height of 4-10 cm, within a distance of 250 m from nearest occupied patch. In patches with a high food plant density the butterfly occurs in patches where the vegetation height is higher, 4-16 cm, and the distance to nearest occupied patch can be longer, up to 1.4 km. This study supports earlier findings in other regions, suggesting that a network of adjacent patches with a high food plant density and a vegetation height within the preferred threshold, despite their size, is an apparent conservation goal.",NA,NA,"2007","SPRINGER","2007 DEC","JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION","11","4","343","350","10.1007/s10841-006-9048-3","1366-638X","WOS:000250538700004","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Betzholtz, P.-E. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Graham, Laura J. and Haines-Young, Roy H. and Field, Richard","The incidence function model as a tool for landscape-scale ecological impact assessments","Landscape-scale approaches to assessing the impact of land-use change on species' persistence are necessary because species depend on processes acting at varying scales, yet existing approaches to ecological impact assessment tend only to be site-based. A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham's landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We find that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal differences in the species' viability measures between the original and post -development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses ofnatural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are sufficient. However, when the cumulative effect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10-20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscape scale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.",NA,NA,"2018","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","2018 FEB","LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING","170",NA,"187","194","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.10.008","0169-2046 and 1872-6062","WOS:000419412400017","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Graham, Laura J. et al.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the implications of habitat loss on the persistence of medium and large mammal species, considering the spatial and temporal changes (years 1985, 2000 and 2014) to the evaluated fragments. The study was carried out in 14 fragments (10.5 - 618 ha), located in Southeastern Goias, Brazil. Records for 24 mammal species were obtained and revealed the two sites with the largest habitat amount in the landscape contained higher species richness than the remaining sites. The three mammal groups based on body mass (weight < 5 kg; weight between 5 and 20 kg; and weight > 20 kg) analyzed in this study showed different responses regarding landscape changes. For larger mammals (between 5 - 20 kg and > 20 kg), there was significant association between current species richness and the amount of habitat in 2014, while the species richness of smaller mammals did not significantly correlate with any of the variables assessed for any of the years. Therefore, the amount of habitat present within the current landscape was the most important variable regarding mammal species richness, especially for the larger species. The time lag was not evident at the time scale evaluated, and this delay in response may have occurred in a relatively short time (< 15 years). For the remaining fragments in the studied landscapes, most are too small to support populations of some larger mammal species and may also leave individuals more vulnerable to anthropogenic actions (e.g. hunting), whose effects may accelerate local extinctions.",NA,NA,"2018","REVISTA BIOTA NEOTROPICA","2018","BIOTA NEOTROPICA","18","3",NA,NA,"10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2017-0483","1676-0603","WOS:000439225800001","AV.

Human activities have dramatically altered rates and scales of processes that regulate biodiversity at local scales [1-7]. Reconciling the threat of global biodiversity loss [2, 4, 6-9] with recent evidence of stability at fine spatial scales [10,11] is a major challenge and requires a nuanced approach to biodiversity change that integrates ecological understanding. With a new dataset of 471 diversity time series spanning from 1962 to 2015 from marine coastal ecosystems, we tested (1) whether biodiversity changed at local scales in recent decades, and (2) whether we can ignore ecological context (e.g., proximate human impacts, trophic level, spatial scale) and still make informative inferences regarding local change. We detected a predominant signal of increasing species richness in coastal systems since 1962 in our dataset, though net species loss was associated with localized effects of anthropogenic impacts. Our geographically extensive dataset is unlikely to be a random sample of marine coastal habitats; impacted sites (3% of our time series) were under-represented relative to their global presence. These local-scale patterns do not contradict the prospect of accelerating global extinctions [2,4,6-9] but are consistent with local species loss in areas with direct human impacts and increases in diversity due to invasions and range expansions in lower impact areas.

IUCN habitat classification data for all 22,386 mammal, bird, and amphibian species, to project endemic species extinctions due to habitat loss to date across all 804 terrestrial ecoregions; and then, (c). Validating the projected extinctions with IUCN Red List. We allocate projected extinctions to the agriculture, pasture, urban, and forestry areas used, traded, and consumed in 129 countries, using an environmentally extended global multi-regional input output database. Results show that for the three taxa combined, a total of 927 endemic species are projected to go extinct due to the impacts of current global land use. The taxonomic breakdown is 186 projected mammal extinctions, 170 birds, and 571 amphibians, with global agriculture land use responsible for 267 projected extinctions; pasture 314, forestry 313, and urbanization 32. Importantly, countryside SAR projections compare well with the number of extinct and threatened species documented by the IUCN Red List. We found that land use for export production is responsible for 25% of these projected global extinctions. Our approach enables parametrization of countryside SARs in any world region even without extensive field studies, and therefore allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity impacts under alternative land use scenarios.

In this study, the historical patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation were assessed in relation to major topographical, climatic and anthropogenic variables that may drive forest loss. Deforestation has occurred almost equally on the two main islands, the North and South Islands, although the remaining indigenous forest is more fragmented in the North Island. Most deforestation has occurred in regions with a high-density of road networks, although gradients in climatic water availability and soil fertility also had weak effects. Deforestation rates over the period 1997-2002 were very low (nationwide deforestation rate of just -0.01% p.a.), but varied widely among political districts. Expansion of plantation forestry was the single most important driver of recent deforestation. Only 10 of 73 political districts are afforded long-term protection of native forest cover (having more than 30% forest cover that is managed by the Department of Conservation). Forest cover in the majority of New Zealand landscapes has been reduced below the level of an expected 'extinction threshold' (circa 30% native habitat cover) in 55 political districts, and long-term trajectories predict that ongoing deforestation threatens to force another five districts below the critical threshold within the next 45 years. Except for the most heavily deforested regions, relatively modest annual rates of habitat restoration could bring forest cover back above the extinction threshold by the year 2050.

Indeed, the niches of some Afromontane trees are up to 50% larger after incorporation of fossil data. This expansion could reduce estimates of species' future range loss owing to climate change but also implies strong non-climatic limitations on species' current ranges. One such limitation is land use, which fossil data suggest influences Afromontane tree distribution, preventing these trees from occupying warmer conditions than they do currently. We aimed to assess the degree to which the broader climatic tolerances revealed by fossil data buffer projected range loss from climate and land use for Afromontane trees. Location Africa. Time period Last 21,000 years. Major taxa studied Afromontane trees. Methods We used species distribution models informed by both current and fossil distributions to project future ranges under climate and land-use projections. Results We found that projected range reductions are only slightly ameliorated by incorporation of fossil distributions, and these improvements diminish further under severe land-use or climate change scenarios. Taxa that are less impacted by climate are more impacted by intense land use. Depending on the severity of climate and land use, the geographical extent of Afromontane tree species' ranges will contract by 40-85%, and the trees will be completely lost from large portions of Africa. We projected that the surviving species' ranges will become increasingly fragmented. Main conclusions Maintaining Afromontane ecosystems will require mitigation of both climate and land-use change and protection of areas to optimize connectivity.

Understanding the impacts of invasive species on natural ecosystems is an important component of developing management strategies. Habitat-forming invasive plants and sessile invertebrates often support a high diversity and abundance of native fauna, suggesting some benefits of invasion. However, the fitness responses of these native fauna, and thus the net benefit from their association with habitat-forming invasive species, are not well understood.2. We determined how fitness-related life-history traits, patterns of resource allocation among life-history traits, and survivorship of an abundant bivalve, Anadara trapezia, responded to invasion by the habitat-forming seaweed, Caulerpa taxifolia, by transplanting A. trapezia into invaded and uninvaded habitats over a 12-month period.3. Although A. trapezia recruits into C taxifolia in high numbers, adult growth, body condition, shell condition, female reproduction and survivorship were all significantly lower in C taxifolia compared to unvegetated sediment. Notably, we observed high mortality in C taxifolia after heavy rainfall events, highlighting a potential link between sublethal effects on condition, stochastic environmental perturbation and survivorship.4. In addition to the overall reduction in fitness, there were changes in scaling relationships between reproduction and body size following invasion. Female A. trapezia in C taxifolia habitat allocated proportionally more resources to reproduction (including reproductive tissue and number of eggs per follicle) than those in unvegetated sediment despite their poor condition. Maximizing reproduction following invasion may impose a further cost to already stressed A. trapezia and contribute to the higher mortality observed when living in C. taxifolia.5. Synthesis and applications. The full impact of habitat-forming invasive species is complex and understanding it cannot be based solely on descriptions of native species diversity or abundance. Our study has identified how the presence of long-lived species within habitat-forming invasive species may simply indicate an extinction debt. A decline in the fitness of A. trapezia in C taxifolia appears to increase its probability of mortality in the long-term. We recommend that management approaches for C taxifolia and other habitat-forming invasive species combine an understanding of impacts on species diversity, abundance and the fitness of associated fauna to provide a more pluralistic understanding, of their effects.",NA,NA,"2008","WILEY","2008 OCT","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","45","5","1540","1549","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01541.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000259788100027","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Wright, Jeffrey I. et al.

Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, ""boom-and-bust"" demography, hybridization and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C.santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C.santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JAN","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","27","2","369","386","10.1111/mec.14445","0962-1083 and 1365-294X","WOS:000428069400005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Richmond, Jonathan Q. et al.

(1) We sampled carabids at 14 highway intersections near Helsinki, Finland. Each intersection (constructed 2-40 years ago) had two forested patches to study: a remnant (0.5-37.4 ha) and, isolated from the remnant by an intersection lane, an islet (size 0.2-1.8 ha). Pitfall trap catch data (2301 carabids, 25 species) showed that remnants hosted higher catches of three carabid species, and slightly higher species richness, than islets (patch-size effect). Time since intersection construction had no apparent effect on carabids. Traffic volume along the intersection lane determined the assemblage structure of carabids in dry patches, and the abundance of a forest carabid Calathus micropterus. Compared to moist patches, drier patches hosted lower catches of four generalist species; they also had different assemblages of carabids (habitat-type effect). An interaction between patch size and habitat type for a forest generalist Pterostichus oblongopunctatus indicated that the patch-size effect was dependent on habitat type. (2) We examined possible dispersal of carabids among forested patches that were separated by highway lanes in Drenthe, the Netherlands. We released 2696 marked individuals of 10 species, and recaptured 376 using dry pitfall traps. We found no evidence for inter-patch movement for nine forest species, but 22 of 225 recaptured individuals of Poecilus versicolor, an eurytopic open-habitat species, had crossed the highway. Catches of seven forest species were also significantly lower in the road verges, compared to the adjacent forests. These two studies suggest that (i) decreasing patch size negatively affects forest-carabid catch and overall species richness, (ii) habitat type can affect the intensity of the patch-size effect, (iii) carabid assemblages of forest fragments vary with traffic volume (which may be linked with urbanization), (iv) forest carabids rarely cross highways, and (v) open habitats associated with road margins are dispersal barriers for forest carabids.",NA,NA,"2005","SPRINGER","2005 DEC","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","20","8","911","926","10.1007/s10980-005-7301-x","0921-2973","WOS:000233036400002","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Koivula, MJ et al.

We highlight the state of the art in conservation science and point to current methods of assessment and future studies needed to mitigate species extinction.SummaryPlant and fungal biodiversity underpin life on earth and merit careful stewardship in an increasingly uncertain environment. However, gaps and biases in documented extinction risks to plant and fungal species impede effective management. Formal extinction risk assessments help avoid extinctions, through engagement, financial, or legal mechanisms, but most plant and fungal species lack assessments. Available global assessments cover c. 30% of plant species (ThreatSearch). Red List coverage overrepresents woody perennials and useful plants, but underrepresents single-country endemics. Fungal assessments overrepresent well-known species and are too few to infer global status or trends. Proportions of assessed vascular plant species considered threatened vary between global assessment datasets: 37% (ThreatSearch), and 44% (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species). Our predictions, correcting for several quantifiable biases, suggest that 39% of all vascular plant species are threatened with extinction. However, other biases remain unquantified, and may affect our estimate. Preliminary trend data show plants moving toward extinction. Quantitative estimates based on plant extinction risk assessments may understate likely biodiversity loss: they do not fully capture the impacts of climate change, slow-acting threats, or clustering of extinction risk, which could amplify loss of evolutionary potential. The importance of extinction risk estimation to support existing and emerging conservation initiatives is likely to grow as threats to biodiversity intensify. This necessitates urgent and strategic expansion of efforts toward comprehensive and ongoing assessment of plant and fungal extinction risk.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 SEP","PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET","2","5","389","408","10.1002/ppp3.10146","2572-2611","WOS:000683439900003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Review","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lughadha, Eimear Nic et al.

The objective of our 2011-2014 study was to determine how habitat characteristics and wetland history can predict occupancy and abundance patterns of bog turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) at the fringe of their range in the southeastern United States. We used a hurdle model to examine occupancy and abundance patterns while addressing problems associated with zero-inflated data. Occupancy patterns were weakly related to percent of the wetland containing emergent vegetation, whereas abundance patterns were predicted by the percent silt in the wetland substrate, percent forest cover, amount of habitat degradation, and recovery time since past habitat degradation. The effect of historical habitat degradation on abundance rather than occupancy patterns has rarely been documented and its effect is rarely studied in vertebrate populations. Identification of predictors of occupancy and abundance patterns will aid discovery of new populations of bog turtles and improve management of occupied wetlands.

In Ukraine, < 5 % of the original steppe area has survived, mostly in nature reserves, loess ravines and kurgans (burial mounds). The latter are small, but relatively numerous objects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plant species density (= the number of species per plot) within small steppe patches on kurgans differs from that within large steppe enclaves in southern Ukraine. Another aim was to determine the influence of patch area, isolation and heat load index on species density on kurgans. Presence-absence data for vascular plant species were collected on plots of a size of 100 and 1 m(2). Thirty kurgans and ten sites within large steppe enclaves were sampled. Every noted species was classified as specialist or generalist. For kurgans data on area and degree of isolation were collected. Additionally the heat load index for plots on kurgans was calculated. The density of habitat specialists was higher in larger steppe enclaves than on kurgans at both spatial scales. On kurgans the most important predictors of specialist density were isolation (negative) and kurgan area (positive). The density of generalists was positively affected by the heat load index. Kurgans can provide refuges for steppe plant species.

"JOUR",NA,"Miklin, Jan and Sebek, Pavel and Hauck, David and Konvicka, Ondrej and Cizek, Lukas","Past levels of canopy closure affect the occurrence of veteran trees and flagship saproxylic beetles","Aim: Open woodlands are biologically highly diverse habitats, and veteran (i.e., old, senescent) trees are key structures supporting their biodiversity. Open canopy structure had been maintained by both natural- and human-induced disturbances. In the past two centuries, suppression of such disturbances, together with forestry intensification, has turned most lowland woodlands into closed-canopy forests. We investigated the effect of increased canopy closure on veteran trees and several threatened beetles associated with them.Location: Floodplain woodlands along the lower Dyje and Morava rivers, Czech Republic.Methods: We used an approach combining the study of aerial photographs with on-ground survey of veteran trees and associated endangered beetles. The aerial images were used to obtain the information on historical (1938) and recent (2009) canopy closure in the area of 146 km(2), where we mapped large oaks (d.b.h. >70 cm), hollow trees and three associated beetles including the hermit beetle (Osmoderma barnabita), the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo) and the jewel beetle Eurythyrea quercus.Results: The presence of large oaks, hollow trees and their associated beetle species are negatively related to recent high canopy closure, and the historical level of canopy closure matters, as in nowadays closed-canopy stands, the beetles and veteran trees are more common in places that were rather open in 1938 than in the places with closed canopy already in 1938. Moreover, the health state of veteran trees highly depends on the canopy closure.Main conclusion: The negative effect of canopy closure on veteran trees and their endangered inhabitants is several decades delayed and may thus often go undetected. In the forests, however, large and hollow trees and their associated biodiversity are relics of the past, more open conditions. The restoration of open woodlands is therefore vital for preventing their further decline.

Species extinction in fragmented habitats is a non-random process described by transient, rather than equilibrium dynamics. Therefore, 'static' approaches focusing on experimentally established spatial gradients of diversity may fail to capture essential aspects of ecosystem responses to species loss.2. Here we document temporal changes in microarthropod species abundance, biomass and richness during a community disassembly trajectory following experimental habitat fragmentation of a moss-based microecosystem.3. Habitat fragmentation reduced heterotrophic species richness and community biomass in remnant moss fragments. Extinction was biased towards rare species, and thus occurred initially without significant changes in total community abundance and biomass. Eventual reductions in abundance and biomass were found to lag behind observed declines in species richness.4. The presence of moss-habitat corridors connecting fragments to a large 'mainland' area coupled with an immigration rescue effect maintained microarthropod richness, abundance and biomass within remnant fragments.5.

In part, this is due to a lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40 longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields) supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape effects did not influence the total number of species in either historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level, landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use history and landscape effects during restoration.",NA,NA,"2011","WILEY","2011 APR","ECOGRAPHY","34","2","257","266","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06381.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000289150000008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brudvig, Lars A. et al.

The results indicate that conservation of traditionally managed hay meadows is of major importance as they contributed 60.1% of all native species recorded; afforested grasslands (deciduous woodlands < 70 years old) contributed 26.8%, whereas artificially fertilized hay meadows and intensively cultivated grasslands taken together contributed 13.1% of the species. The species composition of the meadows was significantly nested. Thus, if you conserve the most species-rich meadows, you also conserve most of the species in the less species-rich meadows. Nestedness in meadows was significantly correlated with within-meadow habitat diversity and soil pH. The most species-rich meadows were traditional meadows, characterized by high habitat diversity and high soil pH. These meadows will support nearly all species including habitat specialists and regionally rare species, whilst artificially fertilized hay meadows only support the generalist subset, i.e. common species. Area was not significantly correlated with nestedness suggesting that it is more important to cover many habitats than to preserve large traditional meadows just because they are large.

Johan and Lawes, Michael J.","Viability of ecological processes in small Afromontane forest patches in South Africa","The conservation of biodiversity is dependent on protecting ecosystem-level processes. We investigated the effects of fragment size and habitat edge on the relative functioning of three ecological processes - decomposition, predation and regeneration of trees - in small Afromontane forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ten sampling stations were placed in each of four forest categories: the interior of three large indigenous forest fragments (100 m from the edge), the edges of these large fragments, 10 small indigenous fragments (< 1 ha) and 10 small exotic woodlands (< 0.5 ha). Fragment size and edge effects did not affect the abundance of the amphipod Talitriator africana, a litter decomposer, and overall dung beetle abundance and species richness significantly. Bird egg predation was marginally greater at large patch edges compared with the other forest categories, while seed predation did not differ among forest categories. Tree seedling assemblage composition did not differ significantly among large patch interiors and edges, and small indigenous fragments. Sapling and canopy assemblage composition each differed significantly among these three indigenous forest categories. Thus, while tree recruitment was not negatively affected by patch size or distance from the edge, conditions in small fragments and at edges appear to affect the composition of advanced tree regeneration. These ecological processes in Afromontane forests appear to be resilient to fragmentation effects. We speculate that this is because the organisms in these forests have evolved under fragmented conditions. Repeated extreme changes in climate and vegetation over the Pleistocene have acted as significant distribution and ecological extinction filters on these southern hemisphere forest biota, resulting in fauna and flora that are potentially resilient to contemporary fragmentation effects. We argue that because small patches and habitat edges appear to be ecologically viable they should be included in future conservation decisions.",NA,NA,"2007","WILEY","2007 MAY","AUSTRAL ECOLOGY","32","3","294","304","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01694.x","1442-9985 and 1442-9993","WOS:000245223800007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kotze, D.

We developed models of habitat suitability indices (HSI) for saproxylic red-listed invertebrate and fungal species, accounting for roughly 70% of all red-listed boreal forest species of the study area in eastern Finland. By using a forestry planning program that incorporates various optimisation methods we analysed trade-offs between timber production and amount of habitats of saproxylic red-listed species within a 60-year period. We also produced production possibility frontiers that show how to increase quality of the matrix with least costs. Moreover, we analysed how habitat suitability criteria used in optimisations affect the area of different habitat quality classes.Our analysis shows that by adopting HSI models in long-term matrix management, it is possible to increase habitats for several red-listed species without substantial losses in timber production. The increase in habitat area is achieved mainly by decreasing the area that is thinned compared to intensive timber production plan. In the long term, this seems to be a novel cost-effective method to increase the quality of the matrix for red-listed saproxylic species. However, the selected optimisation method and the criteria or specification of the management objective for red-listed forest species have a strong effect on results when HSI models are used in conservation planning. Therefore any practical application must be performed with great care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the recognized susceptibility of plants to eutrophication, few studies evaluated how impacts propagate to consumers, such as pollinators. Here we aim to test if soil eutrophication contributes to the temporal dynamics of pollinators and their larval resources. We used a temporally and spatially explicit historical dataset with information on species occurrences to test if soil eutrophication, and more specifically nitrogen deposition, contributes to the patterns of change of plant and pollinator richness in the Netherlands over an 80 yr period. We focus on bees and butterflies, two groups for which we have good knowledge of larval resources that allowed us to define groups of species with different nitrogen related diet preferences. For each group we estimated richness changes between different 20-yr periods at local, regional and national scale, using analytical methods developed for analyzing richness changes based on collection data. Our findings suggest that the impacts of soil eutrophication on plant communities propagate to higher trophic levels, but with a time-lag. Pollinators with nitrogen-related diet preferences were particularly affected, in turn potentially impairing the performance of pollinator-dependent plants. Pollinator declines continued even after their focal plants started to recover. In addition, our results suggest that current levels of nitrogen deposition still have a negative impact on most groups here analyzed, constraining richness recoveries and accentuating declines. Our results indicate that the global increase in nitrogen availability plays an important role in the ongoing pollinator decline. Consequently, species tolerances to soil nitrogen levels should be considered across all trophic levels in management plans that aim to halt biodiversity loss and enhance ecosystems services worldwide.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 FEB","ECOGRAPHY","43","2","209","221","10.1111/ecog.04656","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000495405600001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Carvalheiro, Luisa G. et al.

Changes in habitat availability are reflected in occurrence patterns of habitat-specialist species only after a certain time lag. Here we analyse the responses of wood-decomposing fungi and saproxylic beetles inhabiting patches of spruce-swamp forest to habitat quality, loss and isolation at three different spatial scales in eastern Finland and adjacent Russian Karelia, where forestry has been very marginal until recently. Both rare specialist species and common generalist species were included in the study to reveal whether their occurrence patterns differ. Variables describing habitat quality (density and continuity of host trees, patch area) turned out significant in explaining species' incidences (proportion of occupied host trees) in only a few cases, probably because of the relatively high quality of all study patches. Despite this fact, and consistent with our hypothesis, incidences of all the eight specialist species were higher in Russia than Finland, and the difference was significant in the two most strict habitat specialists, Pytho kolwensis and Phlebia centrifuga. In contrast, incidences of three out of four generalist species were higher in Finland than in Russia, and the difference was significant in Rhagium inquisitor. In a subset of 21 patches in Finland, we used a metapopulation model to predict the probability of each patch to be currently occupied by a species given the known spatiotemporal distribution of suitable forest stands during the last 50 years. The degree of isolation alone explained significantly the incidences of five species. However, including habitat variables into the models altered some of the effects. Moreover, inconsistent with our hypothesis, isolation appeared to also negatively affect some very common generalist species.

We surveyed herbaceous plant communities (of a height < 1.5 m) in 84 hedgerows in the Seine river floodplain of France. Two types of potential drivers for species richness, accounting for landscape mosaic and hedgerow network, were recorded at both hedgerow and site scale. The distribution of species richness through the components of alpha hedgerow diversity (i.e. the average diversity within a habitat) and gamma hedgerow diversity (i.e. the total diversity across habitats) were assessed using additive partitioning methods, while the relationship between species diversity and its potential landscape drivers at both scales was modeled using Generalized Additive Models. Our results indicated that gamma hedgerow diversity is explained by the heterogeneity of the landscape structure, which is correlated with the mosaic of agricultural land use. At this scale, intrinsic properties of the configuration of the hedgerow networks have a weak influence on species richness. Alpha hedgerow diversity is also explained by landscape variables, accounting for both the configuration of agricultural mosaics and hedgerow networks, but to a lesser extent. Time lags for species responses are shown at both scales, and for the two types of drivers. Extinction or colonization debt may be indicated at both scales, while the remnant effects of former practices may also be responsible for such patterns at a local scale. We suggest that hedgerow management should take the specific parameters of both scales into account. At a local scale, management actions should aim to decrease the influence of adjacent land use when the impact is negative, through the implementation of extended buffer zones, while at the landscape and farm scales, agri-environmental schemes should be dedicated to the conservation of specific agricultural land uses.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER","2011 MAY","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","26","5","683","696","10.1007/s10980-011-9593-3","0921-2973","WOS:000291485100007","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ernoult, Aude et al.

To develop effective conservation strategies towards such pressures we need to improve our understanding of how species richness and community composition are shaped by species' responses to landscape patterns. In this study we tested relationships between patch size and isolation, species richness and species traits in a fragmented landscape of calcareous grasslands-a diversity hotspot in Southern Norway. We recorded a total of 381 vascular plant species, of which 50 are considered habitat specialists, distributed among 86 habitat patches (50-9,475 m(2)) in 22 of 50 randomly sampled 500 x 500 m-plots. We found that large habitat patches held more species of both generalists and specialists than small habitat patches and that well-connected patches held more specialist species than isolated patches. About 1/3 of the habitat specialists in this study system showed vulnerability to isolation, i.e. lower probability of occurrence in isolated patches. Traits related both to persistence (short lifespan) and colonization ability (low seed production per plant) were predictors of vulnerability to isolation. Our results indicate that both colonization and extinction processes affect species composition and richness, and that the rescue-effect-mitigation of local, area-dependent extinctions through colonization-is reduced in isolated patches.

"JOUR",NA,"Lommi, Sampsa and Berglund, Hakan and Kuusinen, Mikko and Kuuluvainen, Timo","Epiphytic lichen diversity in late-successional Pinus sylvestris forests along local and regional forest utilization gradients in eastern boreal Fennoscandia","Pinus sylvestris-dominated forests have been heavily utilized across all of boreal Fennoscandia and the remaining natural forests are generally highly fragmented. However, there are considerable local and regional differences in the intensity and duration of past forest utilization. We studied the impact of human forest use on the diversity of epiphytic and epixylic lichens in late-successional Pinus sylvestris-dominated forests by assessing species richness and composition along both local and regional gradients in forest utilization. The effects of local logging intensity were analysed by comparing three types of stands: (i) near-natural, (ii) selectively logged (in the early 20th century) and (iii) managed stands. The effects of regional differences in duration and intensity of past forest use were analysed by comparing stands in two contrasting regions (Hame and Kuhmo-Viena). The species richness of selectively logged stands was as high as that of near-natural stands and significantly higher in these two stand categories than in managed stands. Species richness increased with the density of small understorey Picea, which correlated strongly with decreasing intensity of local forest use and increasing structural complexity of selectively logged and near-natural stands. Stands in the H me region hosted a lower number of species, and were less likely to host many old-growth indicator species than the Kuhmo-Viena region, suggesting that species have been lost from stands in the Hame region due to a longer history of intensive forest use. We conclude that selectively logged stands, along with near-natural stands, are valuable lichen habitats particularly for species confined to old-growth structures such as coarse trees and deadwood. In landscapes where natural forests have become fragmented, the management or restoration of the remaining late-successional Pinus-dominated forests, e.g. through the use of fire, should be carefully planned to avoid adverse effects on lichen species richness.

While a lot is known about the relationships between genetic diversity, fitness, and current population size, very few studies explored the effects of past population size. Knowledge of past population size may, however, improve our ability to predict future population fates. We studied Gentianella praecox subsp. bohemica, a biennial species with extensive seed bank. We tested the effect of current, past minimal and maximal population size, and harmonic mean of population sizes within the last 15 years on genetic diversity and fitness. Maximum population size over the last 15 years was the best predictor of expected heterozygosity of the populations and was significantly related to current population size and management. Plant fitness was significantly related to current as well as maximum population size and expected heterozygosity. The results suggested that information on past population size may improve our understanding of contemporary genetic diversity across populations. They demonstrated that despite the strong fluctuations in population size, large reductions in population size do not result in immediate loss of genetic diversity and reduction of fitness within the populations. This is likely due to the seed bank of the species serving as reservoir of the genetic diversity of the populations. From a conservation point of view, this suggests that the restoration of small populations of short-lived species with permanent seed bank is possible as these populations may still be genetically diverse.",NA,NA,"2018","SPRINGER","2018 JUL","OECOLOGIA","187","3","863","872","10.1007/s00442-018-4152-0","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000436242000024","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Munzbergova, Zuzana et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Leavitt, Daniel J. and Fitzgerald, Lee A.","Disassembly of a dune-dwelling lizard community due to landscape fragmentation","Landscape fragmentation alters patterns of landscape structure that affect quality and configuration of habitats, and disrupts population dynamics and persistence of species. Community disassembly, a process of community change due to nonrandom species losses and declines, is occurring worldwide as a result of landscape fragmentation, habitat loss, and habitat degradation. We carried out a comparative study at 27 trapping sites designed to characterize how fragmentation affects community structure in a dune-dwelling lizard community. Lizard communities in non-fragmented sites demonstrated nested community structure. Conversely, lizard communities at sites fragmented by roads and well pads from oil and gas development had consistently lower abundance of two species, and demonstrated random community structure. Species loss and lower abundance of species at fragmented sites suggested a pattern of community disassembly. The dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus), an ecological specialist, and the lesser earless lizard (Holbrookia maculata) were present on most non-fragmented sites. However, neither species was present on more than half of the fragmented sites, and their abundances were much lower than on non-fragmented sites. We attributed reduced species diversity on fragmented sites to quantitative differences in landscape configuration compared to non-fragmented sites. Specifically, both size and shape of sand dune blowouts differed between non-fragmented and fragmented sites. Fragmented sites possess more large patches of open sand and barren ground and fewer, smaller, and more dispersed shinnery dune blowouts. Patterns of occurrence and relative abundance suggest S. arenicolus and H. maculata were sensitive to these patch-scale attributes. In this ecosystem, landscape-scale fragmentation appears to influence landscape configuration and community disassembly at the patch-scale.

We assessed the extent to which aspect and its relatedness to temperature affect plant species diversity, and the colonization and disappearance of species on alpine summits on a pan-European scale.Location Mountain summits in Europe's alpine life zone.Methods Vascular plant species and their percentage cover were recorded in permanent plots in each cardinal direction on 123 summits in 32 regions across Europe. For a subset from 17 regions, resurvey data and 6-year soil temperature series were available. Differences in temperature sum and Shannon index as well as species richness, colonization and disappearance of species among cardinal directions were analysed using linear mixed-effects and generalised mixed-effects models, respectively.Results Temperature sums were higher in east-and south-facing aspects than in the north-facing ones, while the west-facing ones were intermediate; differences were smallest in northern Europe. The patterns of temperature sums among aspects were consistent among years. In temperate regions, thermal differences were reflected by plant diversity, whereas this relationship was weaker or absent on Mediterranean and boreal mountains. Colonization of species was positively related to temperature on Mediterranean and temperate mountains, whereas disappearance of species was not related to temperature.Main conclusions Thermal differences caused by solar radiation determine plant species diversity on temperate mountains. Advantages for plants on eastern slopes may result from the combined effects of a longer diurnal period of radiation due to convection cloud effects in the afternoon and the sheltered position against the prevailing westerly winds. In northern Europe, long summer days and low sun angles can even out differences among aspects. On Mediterranean summits, summer drought may limit species numbers on the warmer slopes. Warmer aspects support a higher number of colonization events. Hence, aspect can be a principal determinant of the pace of climate-induced migration processes.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 NOV","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY","43","11","2261","2273","10.1111/jbi.12835","0305-0270 and 1365-2699","WOS:000388868700015","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Winkler, Manuela et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Larsen, Larissa and Harlan, Sharon L.","Desert dreamscapes: Residential landscape preference and behavior","The residential landscape constitutes a significant portion of the urban environment. With the increasing mobility of our society, many people come to reside in environments with unfamiliar plant communities and environmental conditions. In this research, 232 Phoenix, Arizona homeowners were surveyed to investigate their residential landscape preferences and to what degree these preferences were reflected in their actual behaviors in their front and backyards. Landscape preferences vary between the front and backyard residential landscapes in a manner consistent with [Goffman, E., 1959. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Anchor Books, New York] about the symbolic presentation of self. When a multinomial logistic regression model was constructed to predict front yard landscape preference with the independent variables income, length of residence in the Phoenix area, degree of environmental concern and engagement in desert recreational activities, income was the only significant predictor. In the front yard, lower-income homeowners tend to prefer lawn, middle-income homeowners preferred desert landscaping and higher-income homeowners' preferences were divided between desert and oasis landscape. While backyard landscape preferences varied among income groups, income was not a significant predictor of backyard landscape preference. Landscape preferences for the front and backyard were significantly different and 55% of respondents preferred different landscape typologies for the front and backyards. Overall, for landscape preference in the front yard, form follows class-specific fashion. For landscape preference in the backyard, form is more likely to follow individual fantasy. Landscape preferences were then compared with landscape behaviors. One-third of respondents expressed landscape preferences that were different from their landscape behaviors. However, the development industry has a significant influence on the design and construction of residential neighborhoods in Phoenix [Kirby, A., 2000. All new, improved! Cities 17(l), 1-5]. In an effort to sell homes, developers' anticipate homeowners' tastes and package their homes with desirable front yard 'dreamscapes' [Jencks, C., 1993. Heteropolis: Los Angeles, the Riots and the Strange Beauty of Hetero-Architecture, Academ Editions, London]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the macro-level influence of the developer's landscape legacy would have a greater impact on the front yard's appearance (behavior) than on the backyard's appearance. For the front yard, both the legacy and the homeowner's preference were significant predictors of landscape behavior, but in the backyard, only the homeowner's preference had a significant influence. The manifestations of the residential landscape reflect expressions of self, status, and conceptions of place that combine to create little understood 'dreamscapes'. We must recognize the importance of the front yard as a visible symbol of self, the backyard's role as a personal pleasure ground, and the conflict that may occur when the natural landscape is relatively inhospitable to domestic behaviors.

We tested the effect of three historical variables on current forest plant communities and traits: forest temporal continuity (ancient: forested before 1860, recent: reforested after 1860, and very recent forest: reforested after 1958) and type of land use in 1860 and 1958 (forest, pasture or arable land). Location The Regional Natural Park of Luberon (southeastern France). Methods We used a comprehensive vegetation plot database (473 species in 1,429 plots). Species' response to historical variables was tested with logistic regressions, and the relationship between plant traits and historical variables was analysed with RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Results Among all studied species, 250 responded to forest temporal continuity, 208 to 1860 land use, and 246 to 1958 land use. Species associated with ancient forests were more frequently forest specialists or forest edge species, shade-tolerant and perennials, while species associated with recent and very recent forests were more frequently annuals, anemochorous and heliophilous species. Species exhibited different traits and ecological preferences according to the type of land use prior to forest: therophytes were more frequent on former arable land while chamaephytes were more frequent on former pasture. Trait responses to 1860 and 1958 land uses were globally consistent. Conclusions The effect of forest temporal continuity and past land use on forest understorey communities was consistent with other studies in northern Europe or northern America, which suggests that the same ecological processes apply in temperate lowland and Mediterranean regions. This study highlights a succession of plant communities in the long term and different trajectories of succession according to the type of former agricultural use.

Even areas that remain predominantly forested may be changed considerably by human alteration of historical disturbance regimes. To better understand human influences on the abundance and pattern of forest habitats, we studied forest land cover change from 1936 to 1996 in a 25 000 km(2) landscape in the Oregon ( USA) Coast Range. We integrated historical forest survey data and maps from 1936 with satellite imagery and GIS data from 1996 to quantify changes in major forest cover types. Change in the total area of closed-canopy forests was relatively minor, decreasing from 68% of the landscape in 1936 to 65% in 1996. In contrast, large-conifer forests decreased from 42% in 1936 to 17% in 1996, whereas small-conifer forests increased from 21% of the landscape in 1936 to 39% in 1996. Linear regression models were used to predict changes in the proportion of large conifer forest as a function of socioeconomic and environmental variables at scales of subbasins ( mean size = 1964 km(2), n = 13), watersheds (mean size = 302 km(2), n = 83), and subwatersheds (mean size = 18 km(2), n = 1325). The proportion of land in private ownership was the strongest predictor at all three spatial scales ( partial R-2 values 0.57 - 0.76). The amounts of variation explained by other independent variables were comparatively minor. Results corroborate the hypothesis that differing management regimes on private and public ownerships have led to different pathways of landscape change.

Recently-developed models of stochastic community assembly allow us to predict the evolution of communities on the basis of mechanistic processes at the level of individuals. The neutral model of biodiversity, in particular, has provided closed-form solutions for the relaxation of biodiversity in isolated communities (no immigration or speciation). Here, we extend these results by deriving a relaxation curve for a neutral community in which new species are introduced through the mechanism of random fission speciation (RFS). The solution provides simple closed-form expressions for the equilibrium species richness, the relaxation time and the species-individual curve, which are good approximation to the more complicated formulas existing for the same model. The derivation of the relaxation curve is based on the assumption of a broken-stick species-abundance distribution (SAD) as an initial community configuration; yet for commonly observed SADs, the maximum deviation from the curve does not exceed 10%. Importantly, the solution confirms theoretical results and observations showing that the relaxation time increases with community size and thus habitat area.

Study of plant community response to these combined disturbances is critical for our understanding and management of these pine forests. Based on data collected from an experimental burn project in central interior British Columbia, Canada, we investigate variation in understory plant communities along a gradient of disturbance that includes MPB-only and red-phase MPB + fire across three levels of fire severity. We compare communities pre-fire and five years post-fire using three hypotheses that predict community response to disturbance: the light hypothesis, the divergence-convergence hypothesis, and the fire severity begets pine hypothesis.Comparisons of pine and fir tree seedling tallies suggest a divergence in composition along the disturbance severity gradient. Pine seedlings were mostly absent from the unburned treatment but dominated the burned treatments with densities increasing at higher severities. For the non-tree understory community, canopy-opening associated with both unburned and with low through moderate-high severity burning results in a convergence of general plant community structure demonstrated by rank-abundance curves, but divergent community membership associated with fire severity and fire-adaptive traits. Communities in the unburned treatment saw a release due to canopy opening that supported increases in the dominant shrubs and understory fir seedlings. In the burned treatments, shrubs also increased in dominance and community membership was determined by fire-adaptive traits with fire-adapted species being most abundant in the highest severity fire treatments. Overall, the communities appear to be resilient to the combined effects of MPB (red-phase) and low to moderate-high severity burning, but further research is required in the grey-phase of beetle-kill to broaden our understanding of the landscape legacy of this recent insect outbreak.

In this study, we examined the quantitative changes in forest cover in the central part of the Sudety Massif (area ca. 1,120 km(2)) during the last 250 years. The information regarding forest patch distribution and its changes was derived by comparison of maps from 1747 and the 1970s drawn at scales of 1:33,000 and 1:25,000, respectively. To examine the effect of environmental variables (topography and soil conditions) and human population density on forest patch distribution and its changes (afforestation, deforestation), a set of 100 circular plots with a diameter of 1 km was established. The influence of explanatory variables was examined using regression tree methods. Changes at the level of the entire landscape were tested using a set of 25 landscape windows (5 x 5 km each). We found that the overall forest cover increased to 36.4% in the twentieth century from 30.4% in the middle of the eighteenth century. The ancient forests constituted 59% of the total forest area existing more recently. The forests in the eighteenth century occurred mostly on steep slopes, deep valley bottoms, and summits. The land relief explains more than half of the total variation in forest distribution (R-2 = 0.56). The effects of soil type and human population density were negligible. The contemporary forest pattern results from both land relief and the historical pattern of human population density in the middle of the eighteenth century (R-2 = 0.64), while the effect of soil type was negligible. The pattern of deforestation (R-2 = 0.53) and afforestation (R-2 = 0.36) results from both land relief as well as recent and nineteenth-century human population density.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in plant species richness, and functional and phylogenetic diversity in northern Estonian calcareous (alvar) grasslands resampled after 90 years of land-use change. Functional traits characterizing species that have benefited most from decreased habitat area and altered environmental conditions, and additional species that can potentially inhabit the remaining grassland patches were identified. Also changes in the relative amount of habitat-specific species were studied to detect a possible decrease in habitat integrity. Although grasslands in the studied region had lost most of their original area (similar to 90 %), species richness had substantially increased due to invasion by more competitive, nutrient-demanding native species. Functional diversity generally increased, whereas phylogenetic diversity showed no response to altered conditions. Overall, these grasslands have lost their integrity as calcareous grassland habitat type in the region, because the relative amount of habitat-specific characteristic species has declined significantly. However, although the grasslands have transformed to a 'hybrid' habitat type and restoration to their previous state is likely not reasonable, such degraded species-rich grassland fragments can still be recognized as important habitats to preserve high local biodiversity and several characteristic species of calcareous grasslands. As current landscapes consist of an increasing number of hybrid and novel communities, new tools to supplement traditional conservation or restoration practices are necessary to recognize and maintain regions and habitats of high local biodiversity.",NA,NA,"2016","SPRINGER","2016 DEC","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION","25","14","3023","3041","10.1007/s10531-016-1218-3","0960-3115 and 1572-9710","WOS:000387715100010","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kasari, Liis et al.

However, information is lacking regarding how the spontaneous colonization of abandoned fields depends on the broader spatial context. We recorded the occurrence of 87 target species in 46 abandoned fields and 339 dry grasslands. We tested the effect of the isolation of abandoned fields from source grasslands on the number of dry grassland species occurring in abandoned fields either with or without habitat characteristics being used as covariates. The isolation of the fields was calculated using the distance and area (I (A) ) or distance and species richness (I (S) ) of source habitats. I (S) always explained the number of grassland species in the abandoned fields better than I (A) . The effect of isolation became smaller or even non-significant with the inclusion of covariates; it also changed with the method used for measuring distance (edge-to-edge or center-to-center), and it was lower when other abandoned fields were considered as additional source habitats. The different performance of the two isolation measures can be explained by the weak species-area relationship in the grasslands, indicating differences in their habitat quality. Species richness is a better proxy of habitat importance in terms of propagule source than habitat area, and the new isolation measure is therefore suitable for studying the effects of landscape structure on species richness in landscapes presenting a weak species-area relationship, such as areas exhibiting pronounced effects of land-use history. Inclusion of habitat characteristics as covariates may considerably alter conclusions regarding the effect of isolation, which might actually be overestimated when assessed separately.",NA,NA,"2012","SPRINGER","2012 JAN","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","27","1","97","108","10.1007/s10980-011-9680-5","0921-2973","WOS:000298228300008","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Knappova, Jana et al.

However, the effectiveness of tree retention for maintaining biodiversity for more than a few years is still poorly known. We investigated lichen persistence in retained buffer strips along small streams after clear-cutting of the surrounding forest, and compared with clear-cuts and un-cut references. Specifically, we compared richness and frequency of red-listed/signal species, calicioids and pendulous species before clear cutting with 2.5 years and 16.5 years after clear-cutting, and also analysed their colonization-extinction dynamics over time. The results show that the richness of red-listed/signal species and calicioids in buffer strips had declined significantly after 16.5 years, but not after 2.5 years, while frequency displayed a significant difference already after 2.5 years. The richness of pendulous lichens remained relatively stable over time, but the frequency had declined significantly after 16.5 years. In clear-cuts all groups declined more than in buffer-strips (-2-3.5 times more) and the main decline had occurred already after 2.5 years. References remained stable over time. The colonization-extinctions dynamics reflected the richness declines, with high early extinction in clear cuts and lower but late extinction in buffer-strips, and low (re)colonization. We conclude that retained buffer strips cannot maintain lichen richness over time due to time-lagged extinction, but they are clearly more effective than clear-cuts. Wider buffer strips could potentially reduce tree mortality and decrease lichen extinction.

Common models predict coherent change in assemblages, with less numerous species becoming locally extinct first, then species of intermediate abundance, and so forth. Relative-abundance distributions should change systematically in landscapes characterized by greater change. Such a predictable sequence of change is not evident in the avifaunas of landscapes of central Victoria, Australia, where relative-abundance patterns in more affected landscapes bear little resemblance to reference distributions. I provide two sets of analyses of relative-abundance distributions: ( 1) analyses that do not depend on the identity of individual species and ( 2) abundance spectra, which use ordered lists of species ranked by species' commonness in reference systems. While abundance spectra change dramatically in smaller remnants, relative-abundance distributions change little, suggesting that the ""reorganization"" of abundances occurs over ecological time frames. The dispersal-limited multinomial is a flexible distribution that may fit many data sets yet be unrelated to assumptions ( species neutrality) and processes ( fixed total numbers of individuals) of the unified neutral theory.

Do the effects from the time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant species?LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden.MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time.ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64% higher total species richness and 110% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of finding a forest species increased.ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation. Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management while also acknowledging the potential conflicts between conservation and production.

Our results yielded five main community types: three meadows, one shrubland, and one forest, with their corresponding diagnostic species. The herbaceous communities were mainly influenced by the presence of flat sandy soils, with varying flooding capacity.

In mountainous regions, we typically observe an uphill shift of species' altitudinal ranges caused by increasing temperatures, but it is difficult to predict how this process interacts with land-use change. Here, we replicated an inventory of bumblebees that took place in the 1960s in Norway. Focusing on subalpine areas, we reported changes in species richness and community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, at low and high altitude. Using aerial photographs and meteorological data, we tested the relationship between climate and land-cover changes and changes in species richness and CTI. We observed an overall increase in CTI consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. There was on average an increase in species richness at high altitudes, while low-altitudes communities tendedto become less species-rich. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between species richness and temperature and precipitation trends, suggesting a detrimental effect of climate change. Thanks to the replication of an historical inventory, we were able to show evidence for an effect of climate, and possibly land-cover, change on subalpine bumblebee assemblages.

Leveraging associations of current geographic distributions of bacteria with historic climate, we predict that soil bacterial diversity will increase across the majority (similar to 75%) of the Tibetan Plateau and northern North America if bacterial communities equilibrate with existing climatic conditions. This prediction is possible because the current distributions of soil bacteria have stronger correlations with climate from similar to 50 years ago than with current climate. This lag is likely associated with the time it takes for soil properties to adjust to changes in climate. The predicted changes are location specific and differ across bacterial taxa, including some bacteria that are predicted to have reductions in their distributions. These findings illuminate the widespread potential of climate change to influence belowground diversity and the importance of considering bacterial communities when assessing climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.IMPORTANCE There have been many studies highlighting how plant and animal communities lag behind climate change, causing extinction and diversity debts that will slowly be paid as communities equilibrate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil bacteria might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions.

Each species was classified into a dispersal group based on ballooning propensity (frequent, occasional or non-ballooners). Two frameworks were used to separate beta diversity (beta(cc) or beta(jac)) of each group into either species replacement (beta(-3)) and richness difference (beta(rich)) components, or turnover (beta(jtu)) and nestedness-resultant (beta(jne)) components. Mantel and partial Mantel tests were performed to determine correlations between pairwise dissimilarities and difference in island area, difference in distance to mainland and inter-island distance for each group.Results The multiple-island dissimilarity of spiders was primarily driven by turnover. Beta diversity (beta(cc) or beta(jac)) was positively associated with difference in island area in frequent ballooners, and negatively associated with difference in island area in occasional ballooners. Difference in island area had positive effects on beta(jne) for all groups, but negative effects on beta(-3) and beta(jtu) for occasional or non-ballooners. beta(rich) was positively associated with difference in island area in frequent and non-ballooners. We did not find any significant isolation effects for these three measures of dissimilarity.Main conclusions The dominant process of extinction resulted in a high contribution of turnover to the multiple-island dissimilarity of spiders. Specifically, frequent ballooners contributed less turnover to multiple-island dissimilarity than occasional and non-ballooners. The most likely explanation for this is that frequent ballooners were potentially able to colonize all islands, whereas occasional and non-ballooners were constrained by water barriers and were unable to occupy most islands.

We studied plant species assembly in grasslands with differing habitat history and hypothesised that trait divergence prevails in historical grasslands due to niche differentiation and trait convergence prevails in more dynamic grasslands due to competitive exclusion and dispersal limitation. We tested these hypotheses in 35 grassland complexes in Estonia, containing neighbouring grassland habitats with different land-use histories: continuously managed open historical grassland, currently overgrown former grassland and young developing grassland. We assessed species assembly patterns in each grassland type for finer scale-a 2 x 2 m plot scale from a local community pool and for broader scale-a local community from the habitat species pool for that grassland stage and observed changes in trait means at finer scale. We found that grasslands with long management history are assembled differently from former grasslands or young developing grasslands. In historical grasslands, divergence or random patterns prevailed at finer scale species assembly while in former or developing grasslands, mostly convergence patterns prevailed. With increasing scale convergence patterns become more prevalent in all grassland types. We conclude that land-use history is an important factor to consider when assessing grassland functional trait assembly, particularly at small scales.

Altogether 12 245 km of line transect was carried out in 1981-2004 in reserves covering 28910 km(2). Bird census data in protected areas were combined into 100 km x 100 km squares. As a group the studied bird species were rather evenly distributed throughout the reserve network. The present reserve network is particularly significant for species having their highest densities in northern Finland, because large proportions of the populations of these species occurred in protected areas. However, over half of the studied species were concentrated in protected areas of southern and central Finland, and only small proportions of their populations were included in the present reserve network. In contrast to the whole species pool of conservation concern, the studied individual forest bird species were not distributed evenly throughout the whole reserve network. This suggests that for most individual species a regionally concentrated network is a preferred option, but for the whole species group the reserve network should clearly be regionally complementary and representative even in the boreal zone, where species have rather wide ranges. Thus, only some species and their habitats can be preserved in a spatially uneven reserve network in boreal forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"JOUR",NA,"Uezu, Alexandre and Metzger, Jean Paul","Time-Lag in Responses of Birds to Atlantic Forest Fragmentation: Restoration Opportunity and Urgency","There are few opportunities to evaluate the relative importance of landscape structure and dynamics upon biodiversity, especially in highly fragmented tropical landscapes. Conservation strategies and species risk evaluations often rely exclusively on current aspects of landscape structure, although such limited assumptions are known to be misleading when time-lag responses occur. By relating bird functional-group richness to forest patch size and isolation in ten-year intervals (1956, 1965, 1978, 1984, 1993 and 2003), we revealed that birds with different sensitivity to fragmentation display contrasting responses to landscape dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For non-sensitive groups, there was no time-lag in response: the recent degree of isolation best explains their variation in richness, which likely relates to these species' flexibility to adapt to changes in landscape structure. However, for sensitive bird groups, the 1978 patch area was the best explanatory variable, providing evidence for a 25-year time-lag in response to habitat reduction. Time-lag was more likely in landscapes that encompass large patches, which can support temporarily the presence of some sensitive species, even when habitat cover is relatively low. These landscapes potentially support the most threatened populations and should be priorities for restoration efforts to avoid further species loss. Although time-lags provide an opportunity to counteract the negative consequences of fragmentation, it also reinforces the urgency of restoration actions. Fragmented landscapes will be depleted of biodiversity if landscape structure is only maintained, and not improved. The urgency of restoration action may be even higher in landscapes where habitat loss and fragmentation history is older and where no large fragment remained to act temporarily as a refuge.",NA,NA,"2016","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2016 JAN 28","PLOS ONE","11","1",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0147909","1932-6203","WOS:000369528400053","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","Article","SAN FRANCISCO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Uezu, Alexandre et al.

We argue that, by including spatial professes in restoration management plans, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation can be offset. Yet few management plans take into account spatial effects of habitat conservation/restoration despite the importance of spatial dynamics in species conservation and recovery plans. Tilman et al. (1997) found a ""restoration lag"" in simulations of species restoration when randomly selecting habitat for restoration. Other studies have suggested that the placement of restored habitat can overcome effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Here we report the findings of simulations that examine different regional management strategies, focusing on habitat selection. We find that nonrandom restoration practices such as restoring only habitat that is adjacent to those occupied by the target species can dramatically reduce or negate any restoration lag. In fact, we find that the increase in patch occupancy of the landscape can be greater than two-fold in the adjacent versus the random scenarios after only two restoration events, and this increase can be as great as six-fold during the early restoration phase. Many restoration efforts have limitations on both funds and available sites for restoration, necessitating high potential success on any restoration efforts. The incorporation of spatial analyses in restoration management may drastically improve a species' chance of recovery. Therefore, general principles that incorporate spatial processes and sensible management are needed to guide specific restoration efforts.",NA,NA,"1999","BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC","1999 SEP","RESTORATION ECOLOGY","7","3","309","315","10.1046/j.1526-100X.1999.72024.x","1061-2971","WOS:000082633800010","350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA","Article","MALDEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Huxel, GR et al.

We predicted that diatom species diversity and equitability are lower in restored wetlands than in reference wetlands and that diatom communities are similar among reference wetlands because communities should be relatively stable over time. Conversely, we predicted that diatom communities in restored and reference wetlands differ because species recovery after restoration may be incomplete or unattainable depending on environmental conditions or dispersal limits. Eight undisturbed, unrestored (reference) wetlands were compared to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatom communities on artificial substrates were transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and vice versa to test for environmental control and dispersal limits to community composition. Species richness was similar at restored and reference wetlands. Diversity and equitability at restored and reference sites were similar within a sampling period, but diversity and equitability decreased over the growing season in reference sites. Based on multidimensional scaling analyses, restored and reference sites could not be distinguished by species composition either early or late in the season. Transplanted diatom community assemblages became similar to those in the wetlands to which they were transferred, suggesting a strong environmental control over diatom assemblages. Diatoms, as a whole, responded rapidly to environmental conditions; yet, dispersal still may limit some species' re-establishment, while resistance to disturbance may produce little response among other diatom species. Diatoms may have limited utility as ecological indicators in prairie wetlands because of the unique interaction between diatom life history and the cyclic hydrology of; prairie wetlands and because diatom community structure is highly variable among reference wetlands.",NA,NA,"1999","SPRINGER","1999 DEC","WETLANDS","19","4","765","774","10.1007/BF03161783","0277-5212 and 1943-6246","WOS:000084526200005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mayer, PM et al.

Since the 1930s, rural sprawl has been increasing in areas rich in recreational amenities. The question is how housing growth has affected landscape fragmentation. We thus tested three hypotheses relating land cover and land ownership to density and spatial pattern of buildings, and examined whether building density or spatial pattern of buildings was a better predictor for landscape fragmentation. Housing locations were mapped from 117 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic maps across northern Wisconsin. Patch-level landscape metrics were calculated on the terrestrial area remaining after applying 50, 100 and 250 m disturbance zones around each building. Our results showed that building density and the spatial pattern of buildings were affected mostly by lake area, public land ownership, and the abundance of coniferous forest, agricultural land, and grassland. A full 40% of the houses were within 100 m of lakeshores. The clustering of buildings within 100 m of lakeshores limited fragmentation farther away. In contrast, agricultural and grassland areas were correlated with higher building density, higher fragmentation, and more dispersed building pattern possible legacies of agricultural settlement patterns.

Landscape change is widely considered as a major threat to species loss at a regional and global scale. However, how species diversity responds to landscape changes on a temporal scale has usually been ignored. In this study, we explored relationships between landscape and biodiversity (species level and functional group level) during different years (1975, 1990, 2000 and 2010) at the Yimin open-pit coal mine, a mine that has been exploited for more than 30 years and that has produced obvious fragmentation effects on the landscape in Hulunbuir City. The ongoing patterns of transformation of the landscape were measured using the landscape dominance index, the habitat integral index of connectivity (IIC), and the habitat probability of connectivity (PC) at seven different spatial scales. The main results were as follows: The present species diversity is significantly correlated with the landscape pattern indices of previous and earlier mining at a medium-sized spatial scale (4-8 km buffers). Different plant functional groups responded in various ways to changing landscape patterns. The species richness of perennial rhizome grasses was significantly correlated with the present small-scale landscape pattern (1-3 km), and the species richness of perennial forbs was significantly correlated with the previous and earlier mining large-scale landscape patterns (4-10 km). Perennial bunchgrasses were not significantly correlated with landscape patterns. We concluded that the time lag expressed by changes in plant species diversity occurred in response to changing patterns of construction and configurations of habitats in the landscape. The regional species pool determined the local species diversity. The connected habitat patches within a 4-8 km buffer region represented the principal species pool. The propagation strategies and dispersal traits of various functional groups were important mechanisms maintaining species diversity in a fragmented area.",NA,NA,"2014",NA,"2014","Biodiversity Science","22","2","117","128","10.3724/SP.J.1003.2014.13130","1005-0094 and 1005-0094","BCI:BCI201400502633",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kang, Sarula et al.

Location The northern part of the Stockholm archipelago, Baltic Sea, Sweden. We resurveyed 27 islands ranging from 0.3 to 33 ha in area. Methods We compared current plant survey data, cadastral maps and aerial photographs with records obtained from a survey in 1908, using databases and a digital elevation model to examine changes in plant community dynamics in space and time. We examined the effects of local and landscape structure and land use changes on plant species dynamics by using stepwise regression in relation to eight local and three landscape variables. The eight local variables were area, relative age, shape, soil heterogeneity, bedrock ratio, number of houses, forest cover change, and grazing 100 years ago. The three landscape variables were distance to mainland, distance to closest island with a farm 100 years ago, and structural connectivity. Hanskis connectivity measure was modified to incorporate both connectivity and fragmentation. Results The investigated islands have undergone drastic changes, with increasing forest cover, habitation, and abandonment of grassland management. Although the total species richness increased by 31% and mean island area by 23%, we found no significant increase in species richness per unit area. Local variables explain past species richness (100 years ago), whereas both local and landscape variables explain current species richness, extinctions, immigrations and species turnover. Grazing that occurred 100 years ago still influences species richness, even though grazing management was abandoned several decades ago. The evidence clearly shows an increase in nitrophilous plant species, particularly among immigrant species. Main conclusions This study highlights the importance of including land use history when interpreting current patterns of species richness. Furthermore, local environment and landscape patterns affect important ecological processes such as immigration, extinction and species turnover, and hence should be included when assessing the impact of habitat fragmentation and land use change.

However, these pressures usually differ across the species' distribution range. To properly assess the combined effect of global change at species level, we need to evaluate its consequences across their complete distribution. We focused on recent decline in Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) populations given its high ecological and economic relevance. Location We selected 10 different sites (and two populations per site) separated about one degree in latitude across the core distribution of Q. suber, following a transcontinental aridity gradient. Methods To evaluate the current trends in population dynamics across the species' distribution and the factors implied on population decline, we evaluated the effect of latitude, aridity, pathogens (Phytophthora cinnamomi), stand density and tree size on seed and crop size, demographic structure, dominance of recruitment bank, defoliation and mortality. Results We found an increase in seed weight as latitude decreased, with a homogeneous low crop size across the complete distribution. Demographic structure was determined by latitude, precipitation and pathogen abundance. We detected a trend towards reduced sapling densities towards the southern edge of the distribution, with a demographic structure dominated by old trees. The low sapling density at the southern edge translates into a loss of dominance with respect to other woody species, suggesting an alteration of community structure in the mid-term future. Tree density, precipitation and pathogen abundance determined tree mortality across the species distribution, with a higher abundance of pathogens in central-latitude populations. Main conclusions Our results allow the early detection of declining trends and the evaluation of the main risks for species' conservation, suggesting potential for range displacement of the species driven by the recruitment failure at the southern edge of the distribution and a likely range expansion at northern populations.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 APR","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","25","4","524","535","10.1111/ddi.12873","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000463154200004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Matias, Luis et al.

Insect outbreaks are a significant forest disturbance that alters forest structure as well as the distribution and connectivity of combustible fuels at broad spatial scales. The effect of insect outbreaks on fire activity is an important but contentious issue with significant policy consequences. The eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is a native defoliating insect in eastern North America whose periodic outbreaks create large patches of dead fir and spruce trees. Of particular concern to fire and forest managers is whether these patches represent an increased fire risk, if so, for how long, and how the relationship between defoliation and fire risk varies through space and time. Previous work suggests a temporary increase in flammability in budworm-killed forests, but regional and seasonal variability in these relationships has not been examined. Using an extensive database on historical lightning-caused fire ignitions and spruce budworm defoliation between 1963 and 2000, we assess the relative importance of cumulative defoliation and fire weather on the probability of ignition in Ontario, Canada. We modeled fire ignition using a generalized additive logistic regression model that accounts for temporal autocorrelation in fire weather. We compared two ecoregions in eastern Ontario (Abitibi Plains) and western Ontario (Lake of the Woods) that differ in terms of climate, geomorphology, and forest composition. We found that defoliation has the potential to both increase and decrease the probability of ignition depending on the time scale, ecoregion, and season examined. Most importantly, we found that lagged spruce budworm defoliation (8-10yr) increases the risk of fire ignition whereas recent defoliation (1yr) can decrease this risk. We also found that historical defoliation has a greater influence on ignition risk during the spring than during the summer fire season.

"JOUR",NA,"McCune, Jenny L. and Vellend, Mark","Gains in native species promote biotic homogenization over four decades in a human-dominated landscape","A long-term perspective is needed to understand how disturbance is affecting plant communities in human-dominated landscapes. Increased human disturbance often results in declining local native species richness, gains in exotic species and a decline in beta diversity. However, it is far from certain whether a general decline in plant diversity is occurring across all disturbed landscapes, and knowledge gaps remain concerning how the spread of exotic species influences beta diversity over long time-scales. We resurveyed 184 vegetation plots in three broad vegetation types on southern Vancouver Island, Canada, originally surveyed in the late 1960s. This landscape has experienced a high degree of human disturbance over the past 40years due to urbanization. We examined changes in total diversity, local diversity and beta diversity over time. We also compiled information on the traits of each species and tested for correlations between traits and plant species success over four decades. We found striking increases in local and total plant species richness driven by both native and exotic species. The most successful species tended to be exotic, disturbance tolerant, shade tolerant and shrubs. Biotic homogenization occurred, but not as a result of exotic species colonization, instead being significantly correlated with gains in native species. The loss in beta diversity has resulted in a shrinking of the gradient of vegetation types, blurring the distinction between them.Synthesis. Our study shows that human-mediated disturbance is the dominant driver of plant community changes, but the net result has actually been an increase in richness, for each plot and for all plots pooled, and for both natives and exotics, despite a decline in variability among plant communities on the landscape. Contrary to conventional definitions of biotic homogenization, this decline in beta diversity was not correlated with the spread of exotic species, but with the colonization of common, disturbance-tolerant natives.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY-BLACKWELL","2013 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","101","6","1542","1551","10.1111/1365-2745.12156","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000325984300017","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"McCune, Jenny L. et al.

However, these species are exceptional because new reproductive generations of these plants are infrequently incorporated into existing populations. A strong mismatch exists between the timescale at which these species provide services to society and ecosystems, and the timescale at which their reproductive stages and population development occurs. Here, we draw attention to these mismatches and their relevance for nature conservation and restoration. We argue that more dynamic management programs are necessary to preserve these iconic species for future generations.SummaryPlants inhabiting variable environments have to adapt their physiology or demography to maintain fitness and, thus, long-term population viability. Demographic storage through long-lived seeds, juveniles, or adults help to overcome periods where unfavorable environmental conditions preclude successful recruitment into reproductive stages. Such storage components can foster long-term population viability of sporadic recruiters, defined here as species with infrequent recruitment caused by a sporadic release from otherwise prevailing resource limitation. However, the beneficial effect of environmental variation reaches a limit when the species' physiological limits are exceeded or the demographic storage components are not sufficient to overcome periods of unfavorable environmental conditions. This can threaten species' long-term population viability in an increasingly variable, human-dominated world. At the same time, long-lived, sporadically recruiting species provide numerous cultural, socio-economic, and ecological services by being part of local myths and beliefs, or by providing habitat, food, wood, fiber, cosmetic, or medical products. In this contribution, we seek to raise awareness of what we call the 'syndrome of long-lived sporadic recruiters' and the relevance of this syndrome for nature conservation and restoration. We outline key demographic features and highlight the main environmental threats for these plants, exemplified for a set of globally distributed charismatic plant species. We propose that fostering the long-term population viability of long-lived, sporadically recruiting plants will require the adaptive implementation of a dynamic management scheme where management actions, monitoring objectives, public outreach and research on the key demographic features of the species are coordinated.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 MAY","PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET","2","3","186","200","10.1002/ppp3.10096","2572-2611","WOS:000683431700003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Schweiger, Andreas H. et al.

These measures are commonly used to assess conservation value of semi-natural grasslands. Landscape context was measured as contemporary connectivity to other semi-natural grasslands, historical connectivity 50 years ago, amount of linear elements potentially suitable for dispersal (road verges, power line clearings), and amount of forest (inverse of the openness of the landscape).Results: The diversity measures were generally correlated with each other, implying that species richness in a subset of the grassland can predict the total richness. Plant species density at three scales (0.5 m(2), 10 m(2) and total) was related to the landscape context using an information theoretic approach. Results showed that total species richness increased with increased size of grasslands, contrary to earlier diversity studies in semi-natural grasslands. Larger grasslands were more heterogeneous than smaller grasslands, and this is a likely reason for the species-area relationship. Heterogeneity was also of high importance at the smaller scales (0.5 m(2), 10 m(2)). With increased amount of forest, total species richness increased but species density on 10 m(2) decreased.

Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina.

A total of 5448 seedlings and adults were recorded, with >55 % of all tree species exhibiting higher densities in small fragments than in mature forest, particularly pioneers (>60 % of all species). Seedlings and adults of these proliferating species differed from species exhibiting population declines in terms of wood density and seed size, respectively. Additionally, pioneers were more abundant than shade-tolerant species, as were hardwood species in the case of seedlings. Tree species showing highest population increases consisted largely of long-lived, light-demanding canopy species bearing soft or hardwood and small-to-medium-sized seeds. Tree assemblage structure also differed in terms of forest habitats with small forest fragments supporting few rare species, whereas the most rapidly proliferating species were much more widespread and abundant in fragments. However, 60 % of all adult pioneer species recorded in small fragments were not recorded as seedlings in this habitat type, although both seedling and adult assemblages were dominated by pioneer species. Edge-dominated tree assemblages are likely to experience long-term shifts toward greater dominance of long-lived, pioneer canopy species.",NA,NA,"2016","SPRINGER","2016 SEP","PLANT ECOLOGY","217","9","1129","1140","10.1007/s11258-016-0638-1","1385-0237 and 1573-5052","WOS:000385197100007","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Santo-Silva, Edgar E. et al.

We used spatially explicit population models requiring detailed habitat and demographic data to evaluate the ability of existing park systems in the Rocky Mountain region (U.S.A. and Canada) to sustain populations of mammalian carnivores. Predicted patterns of extirpation agreed with those from logistic-regression models based only on park size and connectedness (or isolation) for the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in developed landscapes (northern US. Rocky Mountains) and semideveloped landscapes (southern Canadian Rocky Mountains). The area-isolation model performed poorly where the landscape matrix contained large amounts of suitable habitat (northern Canadian Rocky Mountains). Park area and connectedness were poor predictors of gray wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence because of this species' broader-scale range dynamics and greater ability to inhabit the landscape matrix. A doubling of park area corresponded to a 47% and 57% increase in projected grizzly bear population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively. A doubling of a park's connectedness index corresponded to a 81% and 350% increase in population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively, suggesting that conservation planning to enhance connectivity may be most effective in the earliest stages of landscape degradation. The park area and connectivity required for population persistence increased as the landscape matrix became more hostile, implying that the relatively small combined area of parks in the boreal forest and other undeveloped regions may fall below the threshold for species persistence if parks become habitat islands. Loss of carnivores from boreal landscapes could further reduce the viability of temperate populations occupying refugia at the southern range margin. Spatially realistic population models may be more informative than simplerpatch-matrix models in predicting the effects of landscape change on population viability across a continuum of landscape degradation.",NA,NA,"2004","WILEY","2004 AUG","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY","18","4","1110","1120","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00083.x","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000222979400031","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Carroll, C et al.

Freshwater cetacean species, including the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), Ganges/Indus River dolphins (Platanista spp.) and Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), apex predators in megariver ecosystems, face serious challenges owing to the deterioration of habitat quality. 2. We simulated population change of four freshwater cetacean species under increasing habitat deterioration. Carrying capacity (K) was used to represent the habitat quality, and a logistic model was used to describe the rate of habitat deterioration (dK). 3. An individual-based Leslie matrix model showed that population declines and extinctions in freshwater cetaceans under increasing habitat deterioration exhibit a consistent pattern irrespective of the initial level of K or population size. When dK is low, population abundance fluctuates stochastically around initial K, but a rapid increase in dK is accompanied by a sharp population decline, with a residual population ultimately declining continuously to extinction. 4. Simulations show that traditional census survey techniques used in cetacean species are unlikely to detect early signs of population decline before a critical level is reached. 5. Empirical data of the likely extinction of baiji strongly agree with our simulation exercise, implying that extinction of other freshwater cetacean species may occur sooner than previously considered.

"JOUR",NA,"Duwyn, Alisha and MacDougall, Andrew S.","When anthropogenic-related disturbances overwhelm demographic persistence mechanisms","Population decline is associated with increased vulnerability to extinction, but also with possible density-, frequency- or distance-related rarity advantages' that increase recruitment success as individuals become isolated from their congeners. Distinguishing between these alternatives (risk vs. recovery of rare populations via demographic processes) has become critical, given how anthropogenic disturbances are causing population declines globally. Here, we demonstrate how distance-related rarity advantages are evident in spatially isolated recruits of a canopy-dominant but regionally rare species of oak that appears to be suffering recruitment collapse. As distance from parent trees increased, seedlings had significantly more leaves and experienced reduced insect browsing and intraspecific competition. Long-term field-based experimental treatments revealed these advantages to be associated with rapid rates of juvenile maturation and survival that are unobserved in natural settings. The discrepancy between the experimental and natural settings was explained by trophic collapse and habitat loss - two changes ubiquitous to many terrestrial ecosystems - that combine to concentrate vertebrate herbivores in habitat remnants and cause 100% juvenile mortality via the browsing of taller juveniles. Exotic grass cover, long associated with oak recruitment failure, significantly suppressed seedling height and leaf production, but appeared to delay mortality by hiding shorter seedlings from vertebrate herbivores.Synthesis. Our work demonstrates how rarity advantages have the potential to positively influence the population performance of a declining species, but are short-circuited by intense herbivory associated with human-based environmental change. Regionally, there appear to be few existing conditions on the contemporary landscape that favour juvenile survival, suggesting ongoing recruitment difficulties without intervention. Our work clarifies how extinction risk can in some cases be best defined by how anthropogenic disturbances affect, and are offset by, demographic-based persistence mechanisms, than simply by present-day abundance or distribution.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY-BLACKWELL","2015 MAY","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","103","3","761","768","10.1111/1365-2745.12382","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000353640500023","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Duwyn, Alisha et al.

Here, we employ spatially explicit simulations of large numbers of species in spatially heterogeneous landscapes to investigate SARs and extinctions in a dynamic context. The EAR gives the number of species going extinct immediately after habitat loss, but typically many other species have unviable populations in the remaining habitat and go extinct soon afterwards. We conclude that the EAR underestimates extinctions due to habitat loss, the continental SAR (with slope similar to 0.1 or somewhat less) gives a good approximation of short-term extinctions, while the island SAR calculated for discrete fragments of habitat (with slope similar to 0.25) predicts the long-term extinctions. However, when the remaining area of land-covering habitat such as forest is roughly less than 20% of the total landscape and the habitat is highly fragmented, all current SARs underestimate extinction rate. We show how the fragmentation effect' can be incorporated into a predictive SAR model.

Insights From the Brazilian Atlantic Forest","Environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide, but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity. Here, we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the Brazilian Forest Code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Brazil. We gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2,408 rural properties, totalizing 748,601 ha of farmlands within the Atlantic Forest biome and its ecotone with Cerrado, two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Together, rural properties account for 50,783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs). On the basis of this, we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within APPs, as determined by the Forest Code. The simulation of restoration at the property-level resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches, reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size. At the sugarcane mill level, the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity. Despite these benefits, final forest cover (remnant plus restored forests) would still be reduced (< 20%-the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law) in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation. The mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in human-modified tropical landscapes, but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests.",NA,NA,"2018","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","2018 JUL 6","TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE","11",NA,"1","9","10.1177/1940082918785076","1940-0829","WOS:000437516600001","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Article","THOUSAND OAKS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rother, Debora C. et al.

Here we conduct such a review for Europe. Taking in turn the six recognized steps of systematic conservation planning, for this region: (i) The availability of data on biodiversity remains a significant constraint on conservation planning because, although species occurrences have often been better mapped in Europe than elsewhere, there is a continuing mismatch between the spatial resolution at which data coverage is adequate and that of habitat fragmentation. (ii) Although there are important legal frameworks for conservation planning, explicit quantitative goals for the representation and persistence of biodiversity are largely lacking. (iii) Assessment of the effectiveness of existing protected area systems is patchy and rather ill developed, with a substantial gulf between the work being conducted in more academic and policy-oriented arenas. (iv) Nonetheless, particularly through the Natura 2000 process, there has been an extraordinary program to select additional protected areas. (v) Although it has taken longer than originally envisaged, this program is resulting in a substantial expansion of the protected area system.

We compare recent conservation strategies on private land in the context of each region's historical agricultural development and the ecology of its bird fauna. Specifically, we consider which aspects of the conservation instruments and practices employed in European agricultural landscapes might be used to augment and inform approaches to private-land biodiversity conservation in Australia. Australian biodiversity conservation activities have focussed predominantly on remnant native vegetation and rarely target the agricultural matrix (i.e. land that is primarily used for agricultural production). However, declining species include those that not only primarily inhabit woodland, but also species for which components of the agricultural matrix are important, or even their main, habitat. In contrast, in Europe a range of conservation activities undertaken through agri-environment schemes focus explicitly on the management of the agricultural matrix. Whilst the different approaches to conservation on private land in Australia and Europe reflect the two continents' different ecologies, land-use histories and political economies of agriculture, there are a number of parallels between bird population declines in the two regions, and an opportunity may exist to incorporate some of the successful aspects of the European agri-environment approach into emerging stewardship schemes in Australia. We suggest that the long-term nature of European agri-environment agreements, the principle of landholder payments more commensurate with reduced production opportunity and management actions specifically targeted at the agricultural matrix, are features of the European scheme that could benefit both woodland- and matrix-inhabiting bird species in Australian agricultural landscapes.

Especially taxa with specific habitat demands and low dispersal behaviour suffer from habitat fragmentation. One such taxon, the Chalk-hill Blue butterfly, Polyommatus coridon, nowadays mostly occurs in small and isolated, calcareous grasslands across Central Europe. Here we investigate the population genetic structure of 15 local populations of this butterfly species over major parts of the Frankische Schweiz (south-east Germany). Based on seven polymorphic microsatellites we estimate genetic diversity and differentiation. We use the data to test for potential effects of different habitat sizes, habitat connectivity, and population density. We found high genetic diversity but no significant genetic differentiation among the 15 local populations (F (ST) = 0.0087, P > 0.05). Genetic diversity was not correlated with habitat size, habitat connectivity, or census population size. But, we found a marginally positive correlation between increasing habitat connectivity and population density (r (2) = 0.31, P < 0.05). Compared to other butterfly species, our data resemble a generalist species with well connected populations rather than a specialist taxon existing in a highly fragmented landscape. The high genetic diversity and the lack of differentiation might either be the result of relatively large and stable local populations and ongoing gene flow, or is the genetic legacy of formerly large and interconnected populations during periods of extensive agriculture.",NA,NA,"2015","SPRINGER","2015 JUN","CONSERVATION GENETICS","16","3","549","558","10.1007/s10592-014-0679-8","1566-0621 and 1572-9737","WOS:000354375500005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Habel, Jan Christian et al.

Whereas the importance of all these factors has been investigated in a range of previous studies, our understanding of the effects of individual traits on species dependence on landscape structure is still rather limited.

We tested the importance of species traits for species response to the landscape structure.ResultsIn addition to habitat conditions, species composition was determined by landscape structures in the past and at present, and the past landscape structure in each time period separately was equally important to the present landscape structure. Perennial species that are insect- or wind-pollinated, flower over limited periods of time, are relatively tall, are dispersed by animals, are not ruderal, have low nutrient requirements and maintain competitive or partly stress-tolerant strategies were found to be restricted to continuous localities existing at least since 1973 or 1988 and to localities that are currently well interconnected. In contrast, short, self-pollinated, ruderal species prevail in currently less-connected localities.ConclusionsThe results indicate that knowledge of the past landscape structure is important for understanding the current species distribution, and that species traits can be used as useful predictors of species responses to the past landscape structure.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY-BLACKWELL","2016 MAY","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","27","3","545","556","10.1111/jvs.12390","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000375147500013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Husakova, Iveta et al.

However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves.

Location Temperate and subtropical woodlands of Australia. Methods We used expert opinion to develop a definition of the Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community and metrics of its condition. Using continental-scale vegetation change mapping, and national bird atlas data, we assessed this community against criteria for listing as a threatened ecological community under national biodiversity conservation law. Results We defined and described a recognizable and consistent Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community.

In Europe, agricultural intensification during the twentieth century resulted in losses of both grassland habitat and traditional grassland seed dispersal vectors such as livestock. During the same period, populations of large wild herbivores have increased in the landscape. Usually studied in woodland ecosystems, these animals are found to disperse seeds from grasslands and other open habitats. We studied endozoochorous seed dispersal by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in fragmented grasslands and grassland remnants, comparing dispersed subcommunities of plant species to those in the established vegetation and the seed bank. A total of 652 seedlings of 67 species emerged from 219 samples of roe deer dung. This included many grassland species, and several local grassland specialists. Dispersal had potentially different effects on diversity at different spatial scales. Almost all sites received seeds of species not observed in the vegetation or seed bank at that site, suggesting that local diversity might not be dispersal limited. This pattern was less evident at the landscape scale, where fewer new species were introduced. Nonetheless, long-distance dispersal by large wild herbivores might still provide connectivity between fragmented habitats within a landscape in the areas in which they are active.

Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than half of its original forest cover. Most of the remaining forests are small fragments of primary and secondary forest with differing degrees of human impact. These forests, as well as coffee and fruit plantations, may be important in supporting the forest-dependent biodiversity in Madagascar but this has been little studied. In Madagascar, dung beetles, which offer important ecosystem services, are largely restricted to forests. We examined the ability of fragmented and degraded forests to support dung beetle diversity, compared to the large areas of primary forest in eastern Madagascar. We found a general trend of a reduction of species with a loss of forest connectivity. In contrast, a higher level of forest disturbance was associated with higher species diversity. In several sites of low-quality forest as many or more species were found as in less disturbed and primary forests. The average size of dung beetles was smaller in the lower quality localities than in the primary forests. These findings suggest that many forest dung beetles in Madagascar are better adapted to forest disturbance than earlier expected, although they require some level of connectivity to surrounding forest.in Malagasy is available with online material.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 MAR","BIOTROPICA","52","2","351","365","10.1111/btp.12767","0006-3606 and 1744-7429","WOS:000522130500015","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Torppa, Kaisa Anneli et al.

However, the colonization of newly available habitat may lag behind the rate dictated by climatic warming if there exists of a lack of connectivity between donor and receiving areas. The objective of this study was to compare how regional warming affected the biodiversity of marine fish in areas that differed in their connectivity in the Baltic Sea. Location North-east Atlantic, Kattegat and Baltic Sea. Methods The total species richness and the mean species richness from scientific surveys were related to changes in temperature and salinity. Changes in the extent of the distribution of individual fish species were related to the latitudinal distribution, salinity tolerance, maximum body size and exploitation status to assess to what extent climate change and fishing impacts could explain changes in species richness in the Baltic. Results Rising temperatures in the well-connected Kattegat correlated to an increase in the species richness of fish, due to an increase in low-latitude species. Unexpectedly, species richness in the poorly connected Baltic Sea also increased. However, the increase seems to be related to higher salinity rather than temperature and there was no influx of low-latitude species. Main conclusions These results do not support the hypothesis that low-connectivity areas are less likely to see increases in species richness in response to warming. This indicates that the effect of climate change on biodiversity may be more difficult to predict in areas of low connectivity than in well-connected areas.",NA,NA,"2012","WILEY","2012 JUN","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","21","6","637","646","10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00696.x","1466-822X and 1466-8238","WOS:000303856700003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hiddink, Jan Geert et al.

Calcareous grasslands are of special conservation concern as the habitat type with the highest diversity in plant and invertebrate species in central Europe. A baseline survey in 1989 established complete vascular plant species lists for all 62 previously abandoned calcareous grassland patches in the study area and assessed the presence of 48 habitat specialist plant species. An ecological network was initiated in 1989 to reconnect these patches with existing grazed pastures (core areas) through large flock sheep herding where feasible, as sheep are thought to be the primary dispersal vectors for calcareous grassland plants. An evaluation survey in 2009 showed significant increase in species richness of habitat specialist plants in patches reconnected by sheep herding, indicating successful colonizations by habitat specialist plants, while ungrazed patches showed no significant change. Observed increase in species richness between 1989 and 2009 was related to connectivity by sheep herding and the presence of a diversity of structural elements providing microsites for establishment. Baseline species richness of the patches, which had been abandoned since at least 1960, was associated with patch area, supporting the effect of ecological drift, and with vegetation type, which suggests that delays in extinction may be related to site factors governing the strength of competition with later seral species. The implementation of this ecological network represents a long-term natural experiment' with baseline data, manipulation, and evaluation of hypothesized effects on a clearly defined target variable. It thus provides much needed empirical evidence that species loss in fragmented calcareous grassland communities can be counteracted by restoring functional connectivity among remnant patches.",NA,NA,"2013","WILEY","2013 MAR","ECOGRAPHY","36","3","374","382","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07463.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000316468800013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Wagner, Helene H. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Naaf, Tobias and Kolk, Jens","Initial site conditions and interactions between multiple drivers determine herb-layer changes over five decades in temperate forests","The resurvey of forest plant communities some decades after the first survey has become a valued approach to determine long-term responses in species diversity and composition to various anthropogenic environmental drivers, such as management changes, excess nitrogen deposition, or overabundant deer populations. However, little is known about the effects of initial site conditions, such as soil acidity or soil moisture, on these long-term responses and how multiple drivers interact with each other in affecting herb layer diversity and composition. Moreover, the extent to which local changes in canopy cover and composition may mimic or counterbalance effects of regional or global drivers is largely unexplored. Here, we resurveyed herb layer vegetation plots in northeastern Germany after more than five decades. Our main objectives were (1) to determine the effects of initial site conditions, here soil pH buffer range, on herb layer and environmental changes; (2) to disentangle the effects of presumed regional and global drivers from local changes in canopy density and composition; and (3) to identify interactions between environmental drivers in affecting species diversity and composition. We observed significant changes in species diversity and environmental conditions, mostly in dependence on the initial site conditions. Species richness increased only at moderately acidic to base-rich sites, while floristic distinctiveness (beta diversity) generally decreased but decreased significantly stronger on base-rich than on acidic sites. The indicated environmental changes comprised increased shading (particularly on acidic sites), a decrease in soil moisture, acidification (only on initially moderately acidic to base-rich sites), eutrophication (only on acidic sites), an increase in browsing pressure and more continental climatic conditions, probably in terms of increased summer drought (on well-drained sites only). The presumed regional/global environmental changes could not be explained by local changes in canopy composition. The herb layer responses were affected by several important interactions among the drivers. The floristic homogenization was more pronounced the stronger the eutrophication signal, but only on (moderately) acidic sites, while the homogenization occurred independent of any eutrophication on base-rich sites. The environmental change indicators for soil acidity and nitrogen availability showed opposing effects on temporal species turnover and a positive interaction, pointing to atmospheric deposition as the most important driver. Our study demonstrates that both initial site conditions and interactions between different drivers should be taken into account in resurvey studies to broaden our understanding of plant community responses to environmental changes.

The loss of grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.Past and present grassland distribution was a major factor in determining plant species patterns found in grasslands today. All landscapes had an average of 80% grassland 300 years ago. Since then grassland has declined by 90% across all landscapes. Proportion of clay soils influenced the timing of grassland decline, where grasslands in landscapes dominated by clay soils were conversed to crop-fields more than 100 years ago. Grasslands on coarser soils declined later, primarily to forest. Landscapes with more than 10% semi-natural grassland left today had 50% higher species richness in all grasslands, including both abandoned and new grassland. Time since major grassland decline also seems to have an effect on the landscapes' species richness. The results show that plant species patterns in grasslands at local scales are determined by broader landscape processes which may have occurred many centuries ago. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, although stream ecosystems are tightly coupled with their catchments and, thus, probably are affected strongly by historical catchment conditions, few studies have directly examined the importance of landuse legacies on streams. We examined relationships between historical land use (1944) and contemporary (2000-2003) stream physical, chemical, and biological conditions after accounting for the influences of contemporary land use (1999) and natural landscape (catchment size) variation in 12 small streams at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. Most stream variables showed strong relationships with contemporary land use and catchment size; however, after accounting for these factors, residual variation in many variables remained significantly related to historical land use. Residual variation in benthic particulate organic matter, diatom density, % of diatoms in Eunotia spp., fish density in runs, and whole-stream gross primary productivity correlated negatively, whereas streamwater pH correlated positively, with residual variation in fraction of disturbed land in catchments in 1944 (i.e., bare ground and unpaved road cover). Residual variation in % recovering land (i.e., early successional vegetation) in 1944 was correlated positively with residual variation in streambed instability, a macroinvertebrate biotic index, and fish richness, but correlated negatively with residual variation in most benthic macroinvertebrate metrics examined (e.g., Chironomidae and total richness, Shannon diversity). In contrast, residual variation in whole-stream respiration rates was not explained by historical land use. Our results suggest that historical land use continues to influence important physical and chemical variables in these streams, and in turn, probably influences associated biota. Beyond providing insight into biotic interactions and their associations with environmental conditions, identification of landuse legacies also will improve understanding of stream impairment in contemporary minimally disturbed catchments, enabling more accurate assessment of reference conditions in studies of biotic integrity and restoration.",NA,NA,"2008","NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC","2008 JUN","JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY","27","2","280","294","10.1899/07-070.1","0887-3593","WOS:000256178200005","1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","Article","LAWRENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Maloney, Kelly O. et al.

In the near future, increasing regulation of carbon (C) emissions may force forest managers to balance the use of fuel treatments for reducing wildfire risk against an alternative goal of C sequestration. The objective of this study was to evaluate how long-term fuel treatments mitigate wildfires and affect forest C. For the Lake Tahoe Basin in the central Sierra Nevada, USA, fuel treatment efficiency was explored with a landscape-scale simulation model, LANDIS-II, using five fuel treatment scenarios and two (contemporary and potential future) fire regimes. Treatment scenarios included applying a combination of light (hand) and moderate (mechanical) forest thinning continuously through time and transitioning from these prescriptions to a more mid-seral thinning prescription, both on a 15 and 30 year rotation interval. In the last scenario, fuel treatments were isolated to around the lake shore (nearby urban settlement) to simulate a low investment alternative were future resources may be limited. Results indicated that the forest will remain a C sink regardless of treatment or fire regime simulated, due to the landscape legacy of historic logging. Achievement of a net C gain required decades with intensive treatment and depended on wildfire activity: Fuel treatments were more effective in a more active fire environment, where the interface between wildfires and treatment areas increased and caused net C gain earlier than as compared to our scenarios with less wildfire activity. Fuel treatments were most effective when continuously applied and strategically placed in high ignition areas. Treatment type and re-application interval were less influential at the landscape scale, but had notable effects on species dynamics within management units. Treatments created more diverse forest conditions by shifting dominance patterns to a more mixed conifer system, with a higher proportion of fire-tolerant species. We demonstrated that a small amount of wildfire on the landscape resulted in significant changes in the C pool, and that strategically placed fuel treatments substantially reduced wildfire risk, increased fire resiliency of the forest, and is beneficial for long-term C management. Implications for landscape management included consideration for prioritization of treatment areas and creating ideal re-entry schedules that meet logistic, safety, and conservation goals. In forests with a concentrated wildland urban interface, fuel treatments may be vital for ensuring human welfare and enhancing forest integrity in a fire-prone future.

Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens form a significant component of urban green space in many cities and therefore could play a role in redressing this problem. Our ecological and social scientific study examined factors influencing the dispersal and regeneration of 12 bird-dispersed native woody species from Riccarton Bush, a 7.8 ha urban forest remnant, into surrounding residential properties in Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 125 years, the reported number of native vascular plant species in the Bush has declined by a third. Some species, particularly Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, the dominant woody species in the Bush, are being dispersed by birds and establishing in residential gardens predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin. These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to remove all non-planted woody species. This suggests natural potential for regeneration exists but is insufficient without active human intervention. Our survey results show people are supportive of native plants in general but lack knowledge of the species. They are willing to plant locally appropriate woody species if provided with plants, information, and, most importantly, control over the location of plantings.

The long-term history of Quercus in southern Scandinavia has received little attention despite its important role in modern conservation. In this study the 4000-year dynamics of Quercus, its habitat and other important taxa were analysed with pollen data from 25 small hollows and 6 regional sites across southern Scandinavia. The aim was to provide a context for understanding the species' current status and managing its future dynamics.2. The results indicate that Quercus is much less abundant today than at any time during the previous 4000 years and corroborate the rapid decline reported in 18th- and 19th-century historical records. Modern pollen percentages are 45-60% of 17th-century values and only 20-35% of the maximum values reached in the 3rd century.3. A strong positive correlation exists between the abundance of Quercus and the abundance of Tilia, Corylus and Alnus, which also experienced a steady decline across the region in the last two millennia. Climate change is the broad-scale driver of the observed dynamics, but human activity introduced considerable variation in the regional and temporal details of these changes. In the hemiboreal northern part of the study area the decline of Quercus appears to be controlled largely by competition with other tree species ( especially Pinus and Picea), mediated by harvesting. In the temperate south part Quercus forests decreased through deforestation for agriculture.4. Multivariate analyses indicate that although substantial phytogeographical variation has existed through past millennia the regional vegetation is more homogeneous today than in earlier periods.5. Synthesis. The long-term decline and recent rapid reductions in Quercus populations throughout southern Scandinavia are striking and indisputable. From the perspective of both the populations of Quercus and its associated species of insects and epiphytes, the recent rate of decline is extremely rapid. Given the former abundance, longevity and capacity for persistence of Quercus, current populations of Quercus and its associated species appear to represent biological legacies in the midst of protracted decline. Based on these results, a reasonable conservation goal is to restore the abundance and distribution of Quercus to levels that preceded the drastic decline in the 18th and 19th centuries.",NA,NA,"2010","WILEY","2010 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","98","6","1330","1345","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01733.x","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000282978100008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lindbladh, Matts et al.

In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000-2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning.

Little is known about the effects of management practices of old semi-natural field margins, and their historical dimension regarding past management practices and landscape context is rarely considered. In this paper, the relative influence of recent and past management practices and landscape context (during the last five years) were assessed on the local biodiversity (species richness and composition) of carabid assemblages of field margins in agricultural landscapes of northwestern France. The results showed that recent patterns of carabid species richness and composition were best explained by management practices and landscape context measured four or five years ago. It suggests the existence of a time lag in the response of carabid assemblages to past environmental conditions of field margins. The relative contribution of past management practices and past landscape context varied depending on the spatial scale at which landscape context was taken into account. Carabid species richness was higher in grazed or sprayed field margins probably due to increased heterogeneity in habitat conditions. Field margins surrounded by grasslands and crops harbored species associated with open habitats whilst forest species dominated field margins surrounded by woodland. Landscape effect was higher at fine spatial scale, within 50 m around field margins. The present study highlights the importance of considering time-lagged responses of biodiversity when managing environment. It also suggests that old semi-natural field margins should not be considered as undisturbed habitats but more as management units being part of farming activities in agricultural landscapes, as for arable fields.

"JOUR",NA,"Jonsson, Mari T. and Jonsson, Bengt Gunnar","Assessing coarse woody debris in Swedish woodland key habitats: Implications for conservation and management","In the mainland Nordic countries and the Baltic States, the delineation and set-aside of woodland key habitats (WKHs) has been one important approach to conserving biodiversity outside traditional protected areas. Though the specifics of the key habitat concept differ from country to country, the intent is to set aside forest areas that (1) exhibit a low degree of exploitation, (2) host or potentially host red-listed species, and/or (3) contain old-growth characteristics (e.g. dead wood, large old trees) or other qualities considered valuable for maintaining biodiversity. However, it is still uncertain to what extent WKHs actually retain quantities and qualities of coarse woody debris (CWD) that are characteristic of old-growth forests. The Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (BMP) recently conducted a detailed inventory of 491 WKHs across Sweden, providing a large dataset with which to evaluate the effectiveness of the WKH program with respect to CWD. In the present study we analyze the BMP data and compare CWD volume and composition between WKHs, mature managed (stand age 81-120 years), overmature managed (age 121-140 years), and published findings from old-growth forests. The national average volume of CWD (standing and downed combined, m(3)/ha) was higher in WKHs (19.5) than the mature managed (9.3) and the overmature managed forest (12.2), yet was markedly lower than that reported from old-growth forests. CWD volumes in spruce-dominated WKHs had been reduced by 50-63% in the southern and middle boreal regions to 43-64% in the northern boreal region when compared to old-growth forests. In general, CWD amount, variability and quality were greater within WKHs in the boreal regions as opposed to the nemoral and boreonemoral regions in the south of Sweden. The majority of the WKHs (64%) contained key elements (very large and/or decayed dead wood known to be crucial habitat for many threatened wood-dependent species). Considering that these structures are largely absent from managed forests, WKHs have better retained some of the important features of old-growth forests when compared to the surrounding managed forest. WKHs are therefore valuable habitats for dead wood dependent species and representative focal areas for continued and future forest restoration and landscape planning. Our results confirm that large sun-exposed and burned dead wood are underrepresented CWD components within WKHs and emphasize the need to broaden the WKH definition to include locations containing these structures.

Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta-analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time.Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time.We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness.Synthesis and applications: Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.Synthesis and applications:Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments.

In planning restoration and conservation measures to optimize outcomes for biodiversity, such constraints should be evaluated at multiple scales. This study presents a multi-scale methodology based on the concept of triage that incorporates landscape and regional spatial context and temporal dynamics to prioritize restoration and conservation. In applying the framework to a large Brazilian Atlantic forest study site that underwent substantial forest cover changes between 1990 and 2002, our results demonstrate the utility of this framework for navigating between different trade-offs inherent to biodiversity conservation. Landscapes are ranked in accordance with indicators that evaluate the relative urgency of intervention, feasibility of recovery and importance for broader-scale biotic flows.Synthesis and applications. Efforts to enhance biodiversity through restoration and/or conservation may be hampered when decisions are based exclusively on contemporary landscape structure, and not made through a historical perspective. In making such trade-offs explicit, this framework can aid practitioners in defining the most appropriate set of restoration or conservation strategies given the ecological constraints, biodiversity goals and available budget.Efforts to enhance biodiversity through restoration and/or conservation may be hampered when decisions are based exclusively on contemporary landscape structure, and not made through a historical perspective.

Comprehensive approaches are hence needed to understand the mechanisms determining species diversity. In this study, we analysed the impact of vegetation structure, soil properties and fragmentation on the plant species diversity of remnant calcareous grasslands, therefore, in a comparative approach.We determined plant species diversity of 18 calcareous grasslands in south eastern Germany including all species and grassland specialists separately. Furthermore, we analysed the spatial structure of the grasslands as a result of fragmentation during the last 150 years (habitat area, distance to the nearest calcareous grassland and connectivity in 1830 and 2013). We also collected data concerning the vegetation structure (height of the vegetation, cover of bare soil, grass and litter) and the soil properties (content of phosphorous and potassium, ratio of carbon and nitrogen) of the grassland patches. Data were analysed using Bayesian multiple regressions.We observed a habitat loss of nearly 80% and increasing isolation between grasslands since 1830. In the Bayesian multiple regressions the species diversity of the studied grasslands depended negatively on cover of litter and to a lower degree on the distance to the nearest calcareous grassland in 2013, whereas soil properties had no significant impact.Our study supports the observation that vegetation structure, which strongly depends on land use, is often more important for the species richness of calcareous grasslands than fragmentation or soil properties. Even small and isolated grasslands may, therefore, contribute significantly to the conservation of species diversity, when they are still grazed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Species richness was investigated in 63 different grassland patches; grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. and razed ex-arable fields. Influence of landscape variables; area, past and present grassland connectivity. present management on total species richness. density and abundance of 25 grassland specialists was analysed.Results: Semi-natural grasslands (permanent unfertilised pastures or meadows formed by traditional agricultural methods) had declined from 60% 150 years ago to 5% today. There was a significant decline in species richness and density in abandoned serni-natUral grasslands. Total species richness was influenced by present management. size and connectivity to present and past grassland pattern. Landscape variables did not influence species density in grazed semi-natural grassland Suggesting that maintained grazing management makes grassland patches independent of landscape context. The abundance of 16 grassland specialists was Mainly influenced by management and to some extent also by landscape variables.Conclusion: Although species richness pattern reflect management and to some extent landscape variables, the response of individual species may be idiosyncratic. The historical signal from past landscapes is weak on present-day species richness in highly transformed, agricultural landscapes.

For most bees, patches of semi-natural habitat within or adjacent to crops can provide important nesting and food resources. Despite this, land cover change is rapidly reducing the abundance of semi-natural habitat within agroecological landscapes, with potentially negative consequences for bee communities and the services they provide.ObjectivesIdentify how the availability of semi-natural habitat impacts bee communities across biogeographic regions, which may reveal commonalities and key governing principles that transcend a single region or taxa.MethodsWe analyze and compare the drivers of bee community composition in cotton fields within Brazil and the U.S. to reveal how land cover and land cover change impact bee community composition across these two regions.ResultsWe show that the most critical factors impacting bee communities in cotton agroecosystems are the same in Brazil and the U.S.: bee abundance increases with cotton bloom density and the abundance of semi-natural habitat. Further, the loss of semi-natural habitat over a 5-year period negatively impacts bee abundance in both agroecosystems.ConclusionsGiven the importance of bee abundance for the provision of pollination service in cotton plants, our findings highlight the significance of small semi-natural habitat fragments in supporting key ecosystem service providers for both tropical and temperate cotton agroecological systems.

One of the most frequently noted and marked of these patterns is the increase in species richness with area, the species-area relationship (SAR). SARs are used for a number of conservation purposes, including predicting extinction rates, setting conservation targets, and identifying biodiversity hotspots. Such applications can be improved by a detailed understanding of the factors promoting spatial variation in the slope of SARs, which is currently the subject of a vigorous debate. Moreover, very few studies have considered the anthropogenic influences on the slopes of SARs; this is particularly surprising given that in much of the world areas with high human population density are typically those with a high number of species, which generates conservation conflicts. Here we determine correlates of spatial variation in the slopes of species-area relationships, using the British avifauna as a case study. Whilst we focus on human population density, a widely used index of human activities, we also take into account (1) the rate of increase in habitat heterogeneity with increasing area, which is frequently proposed to drive SARs, (2) environmental energy availability, which may influence SARs by affecting species occupancy patterns, and (3) species richness. We consider environmental variables measured at both local (10 km x 10 km) and regional (290 km x 290 km) spatial grains, but find that the former consistently provides a better fit to the data. In our case study, the effect of species richness on the slope SARs appears to be scale dependent, being negative at local scales but positive at regional scales. In univariate tests, the slope of the SAR correlates negatively with human population density and environmental energy availability, and positively with the rate of increase in habitat heterogeneity. We conducted two sets of multiple regression analyses, with and without species richness as a predictor. When species richness is included it exerts a dominant effect, but when it is excluded temperature has the dominant effect on the slope of the SAR, and the effects of other predictors are marginal.",NA,NA,"2007","RESILIENCE ALLIANCE","2007 DEC","AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY","2","2",NA,NA,NA,"1712-6568","WOS:000208195500007","ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA","Article","WOLFVILLE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Evans, Karl L. et al.

Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast Majority of the planet's biota, particularly local endemics.By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of invertebrates.By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally, co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the classification process.As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter (27%) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically Endangered, 19% as Endangered, 6% as Vulnerable and 8% as Least Concern.

The 'passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat(7,8), whereas the 'ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone(9,10). Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments-when controlled for sampling effort-contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.Analysis of 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa from fragmented habitats finds that increasing fragmentation has a disproportionately large effect on biodiversity loss, supporting the ecosystem decay hypothesis.",NA,NA,"2020","NATURE RESEARCH","2020 AUG 13","NATURE","584","7820","238","+","10.1038/s41586-020-2531-2","0028-0836 and 1476-4687","WOS:000554511600002","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Article","BERLIN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Chase, Jonathan M. et al.

Conservation management often encompasses multiple, alternative management actions on a given site, involving habitat restoration and maintenance for example. Which actions are preferable depends on the conservation goals, the expected outcomes of actions, and their associated costs. When actions affect habitat quality differently, species that vary in habitat requirements will not respond to the actions in the same way. When all these species are of conservation concern, trade-offs between them are inevitable and the selection of appropriate actions becomes less straightforward. Although this is a common planning problem, it has received little attention in the conservation planning literature.2. We demonstrate how to obtain cost-effective planning solutions for a set of species with contrasting requirements, when multiple alternative conservation actions are available for each site. We investigate the strength of trade-offs between species with different habitat preferences, when planning optimal management of a set of semi-natural mesic grassland sites. A community of vascular plants and Lepidoptera species depends on such grasslands, which are maintained by cattle grazing. The various species differ in their responses to grazing intensity. We apply an algorithm that selects a grazing intensity for each site to maximize the benefit over all species, under a given budget constraint.3. The optimal grazing intensity for sites, and consequently, the expected representation of species, was sensitive to the relative values assigned to species (weights) and the budget available. The outcome also depended on assumptions regarding species representation under suboptimal management. A sensitivity analysis showed that the trade-offs between species were strong, illustrating the potentially significant consequences of conservation decisions.4. Synthesis and applications. Maximizing conservation benefit over all species may result in high representation of some species at the cost of others. Although this is a natural consequence of budget limitations and conservation priorities, understanding these consequences is essential if planning is to accommodate species with different conservation needs. Our methodology is a novel extension of conventional reserve selection methods and can support planning for species with contrasting requirements, leading to more robust and cost-effective conservation decisions.",NA,NA,"2008","WILEY-BLACKWELL","2008 OCT","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","45","5","1401","1409","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01514.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000259788100011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"van Teeffelen, Astrid J.

For each species we obtained the values or states for a set of plant functional traits: plant height, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, seed production, seed weight, life form and lateral expansion. To account for the effect of phylogeny, we evaluated trait diversity skewness by means of an ultrametric phylogenetic tree specifically constructed for the species studied. The association between both environmental gradients and past disturbance, and plant functional traits was tested by means of RLQ analysis.ResultsOf all the traits, only seed weight showed a phylogenetic signal; consequently, phylogeny was not included in the RLQ analysis. Conductivity was negatively correlated with seed weight, whereas water table conditions and soil ionic balance were negatively correlated with specific leaf area. Past disturbance was negatively correlated with leaf dry matter content and with lateral expansion.ConclusionsPlant traits of Llobregat Delta coastal marsh communities are conditioned by environmental gradients and by past land use. Soil ionic balance and water table conditions determine key plant functional traits such as specific leaf area. This finding also corroborates the importance of soil ionic balance as a plant life driver in microtidal Mediterranean marshes.

The marsh fritillary Euphydryas aurinia is one of our most endangered butterflies, and the only to be protected under European legislation as well as British. It persists in fragile subpopulations threatened by habitat fragmentation and degradation. 2. A combination of swaling and cattle grazing are accepted to be best practice for managing wet, unimproved grasslands-the favoured habitat for E. aurinia in Cornwall. These two well-endorsed methods of management were used to increase and improve the quality of habitat for E. aurinia over a 5 years period, 2004-2008, at a stronghold network of habitat patches in mid Cornwall, south-west England. 3. Analyses of adult and larval densities over 5 years in fifty-four transects across nine sites found E. aurinia to favour habitat patches with higher densities of the larval food plant (Devil's-bit scabious Succisa pratensis), higher sward height in autumn, and intermediate optimum levels of stock grazing. 4. Main findings indicated most sites experienced significant declines in numbers. Unfavourable weather in the last 2 years of monitoring was likely to have had a significant impact on the response of individual subpopulations to habitat management though poor recovery rates may also reflect a time-lag in colonisation events after habitat improvement has occurred. 5. Habitat management produced an improvement, albeit an inconsistent improvement in habitat variables across patches-S. pratensis shows a clear recovery at some sites. Autumn sward height increased significantly at one site, and a quadratic relationship between stock grazing and important habitat variables has been found which will aid further improvement over all sites for the long term persistence of E. aurinia.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER","2011 APR","JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION","15","1-2","153","163","10.1007/s10841-010-9334-y","1366-638X and 1572-9753","WOS:000287359200014","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Smee, Melanie et al.

Forests growing on kames, eskers and various moraine hillocks common in regions with Holocene glaciation are good examples of this approach. In Estonia, these forests locally persist as fragments of continuous primary forest, but usually they are situated on former slash-and-burn areas (bushlands) or reforested agricultural land. Our aim was to elucidate the strength of the effect of long-term land-use history on the present-day vegetation compositions of mature hillock forests and their soil chemistry. It appeared that even the mature secondary hillock forests are still distinct from historically continuous stands in terms of species composition. We discovered connections between stand history and species content in hillock forests as well as transformed soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen contents in the humus horizons of secondary forests are lower while their carbon-nitrogen ratios are higher than in continuous forests. The relationship between vegetation and stand history is demonstrated by the higher proportions of anthropophytic and apophytic species in the herb layer of the secondary forests. The presence of species that are tolerant of anthropogenic impact on the secondary hillock forests floor can also be partly explained by the effect of different species in the tree and shrub layers, gaps in the tree canopy, and the boundary effect caused by the small areas of forest patches, neighboring grasslands or fields. The extinction debt in secondary communities should also be considered.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER TOKYO","2011 JUN","JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH","16","3","244","252","10.1007/s10310-011-0258-5","1341-6979","WOS:000294712600011","1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN","Article","TOKYO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Paal, Jaanus et al.

Quantifying the severity of the issue and informing adaptation measures presents a challenge to ecological modelling.We undertook a study of biodiversity impacts and adaptation using spatial modelling across southeastern Australia. The study aimed to (1) forecast future impacts on biodiversity arising from 18 plausible climate futures, and (2) identify places where land management actions including revegetation will maximise expected improvements to projected biodiversity persistence. This work augments well-tested regional-scale biodiversity assessment by considering an uncertain future climate.Generalised Dissimilarity Models (GDMs) were developed at two baselines (1990 and 2000) to characterise the continuous nature of compositional turnover of vascular plants varying with climate, soils and landform across the region. The classified outputs of the GDM, representing a vegetation-based biodiversity surrogate, were projected using kernel regression to simulate changing distributions for the future epochs 2020, 2030, 2050 and 2070, referred to as Bio-climatic Classes (BCC). BCC distributions were combined with a model of current ecosystem condition and applied to a range of biodiversity assessment methodologies, including the Biodiversity Forecasting Tool, the Spatial Links Tool and a new coupled time-series metapopulation occupancy model.The BFT evaluation of the BCC distributions and their respective ecosystem conditions, forecasts a reduction in biodiversity persistence across the region of between 3 and 20 percent by 2070 (due to climate change only) adding to a past loss of 20 percent since European settlement (due to land use change only, not other factors such as weeds and pests). Maps of compositional dissimilarity change in vascular plants point to varying degrees of expected change in biodiversity across south-eastern Australia. Conservation benefit analysis indicates a general increase and re-distribution of the relative benefits of undertaking conservation to sustain or enhance biodiversity across the region. Results have been incorporated into novel visualisations, to assist environmental managers and others to interpret the complex concepts and issues associated with the work, and support regional adaptation planning.

Researchers and land managers generally assume that the present distributions of biological indicator species are influenced by the current environment. However, recent studies have suggested the importance of past environments to species distributions (i.e., a time lag between changes in species distribution and habitat alterations). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the effects of past environments on the distributions of indicator species.We conducted a survey on the Tokachi Plain in Hokkaido, Japan. We targeted two taxa that have been widely used as indicator species (carabid beetles and bats) and investigated whether past landscape environments influenced their present distributions. We showed that past landscape environments (5 decades prior to the present) influenced the distributions of some ecological trait groups in each taxon (large body size for carabid beetles and a 25 kHz peak echolocation frequency for bats) and that these effects varied among groups. Our results suggest the need to consider the dynamics of land-use changes and the effects of past environments on the distributions of indicator taxa, otherwise we may misunderstand the effects of environmental degradation on biodiversity.

Land-use change is considered one of the most radical and extensive disturbances that have influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of Europe and eastern North America. In forests growing on former agricultural land, local species diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared with ancient forests (i.e. forests with no historical record of agriculture). Yet, no study has determined how the compositional differences created by former land-use change over time as the forest sites recover from former agricultural use.2. Here, we resurveyed 78 vegetation plots (half of the plots in ancient and half in post-agricultural forest) to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional differences between post-agricultural and ancient forest sites. The impact of land-use history and survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence.3. The data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time, yet not through compositional stability. Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and post-agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged, which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly accepted model of community development in post-agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species. The source populations of ancient forest species have been gradually depleted, so the recovery of post-agricultural forests becomes even more precarious.4. Synthesis. While land-use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species diversity and community divergence, other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on the time scale of only decades.",NA,NA,"2010","WILEY","2010 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","98","6","1447","1453","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01711.x","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000282978100018","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Baeten, Lander et al.

The specific species group analysed may affect their applicability. We asked if species-area curves constructed from extensive databases of various sectors of natural resource administration can provide insights into large-scale conservation of boreal forest biodiversity if the analyses are restricted only to red-listed species.LocationFinland, northern Europe.MethodsOur data included 12,645 records of 219 red-listed Coleoptera and Fungi from the whole of Finland. The forest data also covered the entire country, 202,761 km(2). The units of species-area analyses were 224 municipalities where the red-listed forest species have been observed. We performed a hierarchical partitioning analysis to reveal the relative importance of different potential explanatory variables. Based on the results, for all red-listed species, species associated with coniferous trees and for Fungi, the area of economically over-aged forests explained the best the variation in data. For species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera, the forest area explained better variation in data than the area of old forests. In the subsequent log-log species-area regression analyses, we used the best variables as the explanatory variable for each species group.ResultsThere was a strong relationship between the number of all red-listed species and the area of old forests remaining, with a z-value of 0.45. The area explained better the number of species associated with conifer trees and Fungi than the number of species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera.Main conclusionsThe high z-values of species-area curves indicate that the remaining old-growth patches constitute a real archipelago for the conifer-associated red-listed species, since lower values had been expected if the surrounding habitat matrix were a suitable habitat for the species analysed.",NA,NA,"2009","WILEY","2009 SEP","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","15","5","852","862","10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00590.x","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000269264300012","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tikkanen, Olli-Pekka et al.

Nicolas and Purvis, Andy","The effect of fragment area on site-level biodiversity","Habitat fragmentation accompanies habitat loss, and drives additional biodiversity change; but few global biodiversity models explicitly analyse the effects of both fragmentation and loss. Here we propose and test the hypothesis that, as fragment area increases, species density (the number of species in a standardised plot) will scale with an exponent given by the difference between the exponents of the species-area relationships for islands (z similar to 0.25) and in contiguous habitat (z similar to 0.15), and test whether scaling varies between land uses. We also investigate the scaling of overall abundance and rarefaction-based richness, as some mechanisms make different predictions about how fragment area should affect them. The relevant data from the taxonomically and geographically broad PREDICTS database were used to model the three diversity measures, testing their scaling with fragment area and whether the scaling exponent varied among land uses (primary forest, secondary forest, plantation forest, cropland and pasture). In addition, the consistency of the response of species density to fragment area was tested across three well represented taxa (Magnoliopsida, Hymenoptera and herptiles'). Species density and total abundance showed area-scaling exponents of 0.07 and 0.16, respectively, and these exponents did not vary significantly among land uses; rarefaction-based richness by contrast did not increase consistently with area. These results suggest that the area-scaling of species density is driven by the area-scaling of total abundance, with additive edge effects (species moving into the small fragments from the surroundings) opposing - but not fully overcoming - the effect of fragment area on overall density of individuals. The interaction between fragment area and higher taxon (plants, vertebrates and invertebrates), which remained in the rarefied richness model, indicates that mechanisms may vary among groups.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 JUL","ECOGRAPHY","41","7","1220","1231","10.1111/ecog.02956","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000436854100015","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Phillips, Helen R.

The importance of their interactions is widely recognized, but remains poorly understood. We used the endemic-rich bird assemblage of Sao Tome Island to study this type of interactions. We built species-specific binomial generalized linear models for 33 terrestrial bird species, based on presence-absence data from 2398 sampling points. Meta-analysis techniques revealed that land use was more important in explaining distribution than topographic variables, rainfall, or distance to coast for the studied bird species. Native species were more likely to occur in remote rainy forests at higher altitudes, whereas non-native species were more likely to occur in non-forested ecosystems, being associated with humanized lowland areas in the drier flat regions of Sao Tome. The susceptibility of anthropogenic ecosystems to the establishment of non-native birds suggests that disturbance favours these species. An analysis of species feeding guilds further suggests that these habitat associations might be linked to resource availability, as a large proportion of non-native species rely on seeds, which are clearly more available outside the best-preserved forests. Contrarily, very few native birds seem to be using this resource, and instead rely on more complex ecological interaction, such as carnivory and frugivory. This difference may reduce the chance of negative interactions between native and non-native species (e.g. competition), but this should not be misunderstood for a lack of negative effects of the latter. Our results indicate that land-use intensification is the key driver of biodiversity changes on Sao Tome, potentially facilitating the expansion of non-native species and demoting ecological complexity. Therefore, protecting the best-preserved forests is the single most important measure to ensure the conservation of native species.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 OCT","ANIMAL CONSERVATION","23","5","573","584","10.1111/acv.12568","1367-9430 and 1469-1795","WOS:000515226100001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Soares, F.

Whether this harvest has indirect effects on nonhunted organisms that interact with the game species is a critical question. Many tropical birds and mammals disperse seeds. Their overhunting in forests can cause zoochorous trees to suffer from reduced seed dispersal. Yet how these reductions in seed dispersal influence tree abundance and population dynamics remains unclear. Reproductive parameters in long-lived organisms often have very low elasticities; indeed the demographic importance of seed dispersal is an open question. We asked how variation in hunting pressure across four national parks with seasonal forest in northern Thailand influenced the relative abundance of gibbons, muntjac deer, and sambar deer, the sole dispersers of seeds of the canopy tree Choerospondias axillaris. We quantified how variation in disperser numbers affected C. axillaris seed dispersal and seedling abundance across the four parks. We then used these data in a structured population model based on vital rates measured in Khao Yai National Park (where poaching pressure is minimal) to explore how variation in illegal hunting pressure might influence C. axillaris population growth and persistence. Densities of the mammals varied strongly across the parks, from relatively high in Khao Yai to essentially zero in Doi Suthep-Pui. Levels of C. axillaris seed dispersal and seedling abundance positively tracked mammal density. If hunting in Khao Yai were to increase to the levels seen in the other parks, C. axillaris population growth rate would decline, but only slightly. Extinction of C. axillaris is a real possibility, but may take many decades. Recent and ongoing extirpations of vertebrates in many tropical forests could be creating an extinction debt for zoochorous trees whose vulnerability is belied by their current abundance.",NA,NA,"2009","WILEY","2009 JUL","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","19","4","854","863","10.1890/08-0955.1","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","WOS:000266281400004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brodie, Jedediah F. et al.

We asked whether tree planting for ecological restoration accelerates epiphyte community recovery. Does the spatial configuration of tree planting matter? What landscape contexts are most suitable for epiphyte restoration?Location: Restored pastures in premontane Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.Methods: We surveyed vascular epiphyte species growing on the lower trunks of 1083 trees in 13 experimental restoration sites. Each site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: natural regeneration, trees planted in patches or 'islands' and tree plantations. Sites spanned elevational (1100-1430 m) and deforestation (4-94% forest cover within a 100-m radius around each site) gradients.Results: Vascular epiphytes were twice as diverse in planted restoration plots (islands and plantations) as in natural regeneration; we observed this at the scale of individual host trees and within 0.25-ha treatment plots. Contributing factors included that trees in planted restoration plots were larger, older, more abundant and composed of different species than trees in naturally regenerating plots. Epiphyte species richness increased with surrounding forest cover within 100150 m of restoration plots. Epiphyte communities were also twice as diverse at higher (1330-1430 m) vs lower (1100-1290 m) elevation sites. Epiphyte groups responded differently to restoration treatments and landscape factors; ferns were responsible for higher species richness in planted restoration plots, whereas angiosperms drove elevation and forest cover effects.Conclusions: Tree planting for ecological restoration enriched epiphyte communities compared to natural regeneration, likely because planted forests contained more, bigger and older trees. Tree island plantings were equally effective compared to larger and more expensive plantations. Restoration sites nearer to existing forests had richer epiphyte recolonization, likely because nearby forests provisioned restoration sites with angiosperm seeds. Collectively, results suggest that restoration practitioners can enrich epiphyte community development by planting trees in areas with higher surrounding forest cover, particularly at higher elevations.",NA,NA,"2016","WILEY","2016 JUL","APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE","19","3","508","517","10.1111/avsc.12234","1402-2001 and 1654-109X","WOS:000384751300014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Reid, John Leighton et al.

The complex changes these forces impose often go unnoticed due to a lack of reliable baseline data. Using historical data from the 1950s and re-survey data on floodplain forest understories, we ask: (1) what is the direction, magnitude and nature of changes in local and regional diversity; (2) have these floodplain communities become more homogenous in composition due to losses of native species and increases in non-natives; (3) has the relationship between the ground layer and overstorey community weakened over time; and (4) are changes in local and regional diversity among these floodplain forests more or less pronounced than in nearby upland forests?LocationFloodplain forests throughout southern Wisconsin, USA.MethodsWe quantified composition of vegetation in the understorey and overstorey of 40 sites and compared these data with data from the 1950s using a combination of uni- and multivariate analyses. We focus on changes in local vs regional diversity.ResultsAlthough average site-level diversity has increased by 18.5%, sites are now 30% more similar to each other, reflecting a pronounced decline in among-site (beta) diversity. Although exotic species have increased in site occupancy and abundance, increases in native woody plants (+30%), graminoids (+24%) and forbs (+16%) drive most of these changes in local and regional diversity. Sites have experienced an average species turnover rate of 39% since the 1950s, and understories are now 39% more correlated with canopy composition than in the 1950s. Biotic homogenization among these floodplain forests since the 1950s is 23.3% higher than the increase in similarity observed in nearby upland forests.ConclusionsVegetation changes in floodplain understories differ from changes previously documented in nearby upland forests. Floodplain forests have experienced a faster rate of biotic homogenization. Unlike upland forests the homogenization trend in these floodplain forests is accompanied by increases in site-level diversity. These may reflect widespread colonization by certain native species.

Treating human-environmental dynamics as a dichotomous phenomenon-turning ""on"" or ""off"" at some tipping point in the past-misses the broader, longer-term, and varied role humans play in creating lasting ecological legacies. To investigate these more subtle human-environmental dynamics, we propose an interdisciplinary framework, for evaluating past and predicting future landscape change focused on human-fire legacies. Linking theory and methods from behavioral and landscape ecology, we present a coupled framework capable of explaining how and why humans make subsistence decisions and interact with environmental variation through time.

New native woodlands are typically created in a small and isolated configuration, potentially reducing their value as a resource for biodiversity. The use of ecological networks for habitat restoration and creation could be beneficial for woodland biodiversity. This approach is conceptualised as local-and landscape-scale conservation actions designed to increase the area, quality, amount and connectivity of habitat types. However, there is limited evidence about the value of secondary woodlands and the relative or combined effects of network variables for woodland insects.2. Seventy-eight woodland sites created in the last 160 years across England and Scotland were sampled for hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) and craneflies (Diptera: Tipuloidea), using two Malaise net traps placed in the centre of each woodland. The diversity of insects supported by created woodland patches was analysed using measures of dissimilarity, and the relative direct and indirect effects of ecological network variables on their abundance and species richness were assessed using structural equation models.3. We found 27% of British woodland hoverfly species and 43% of British woodland cranefly species in the study sites, indicating that woodland insects are colonising created native woodlands, despite their fragmented nature. However, these species communities were highly variable across woodland patches.4. Landscape-scale variables had no effect on woodland-associated hoverflies or craneflies relative to local-scale variables. Local-scale variables relating to habitat quality (i.e. structural heterogeneity of trees and understorey cover) had the strongest influence on abundance and species richness.5. Synthesis and applications. To benefit woodland-associated Diptera, woodland creation and restoration should maintain a focus on habitat quality. This should include active management to facilitate a diverse tree and understorey vegetation structure. Many woodlands in the UK are privately owned, and landowners should be encouraged to plant and actively manage their woodlands to increase structural heterogeneity and resources for woodland insects.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 MAY","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY","55","3","1173","1184","10.1111/1365-2664.13035","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000430059500014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Fuller, Lauren et al.

In turn, spatial legacies in age and composition can facilitate or constrain further disturbances and have important consequences for forest spatial structure and sustainability. However, the complex three-way interactions among fire, insects, and logging and their combined effects on forest spatial structure have seldom been investigated. We used a spatially explicit landscape simulation model to examine these interactions. Specifically, we investigated how the amount and the spatial scale of logging (cutblock size) in combination with succession, fire, and spruce budworm outbreaks affect area burned and area defoliated. Simulations included 30 replicates of 300 years for each of 19 different disturbance scenarios. More disturbances increased both the fragmentation and the proportion of coniferous species and imposed additional constraints on the extent of each disturbance. We also found that harvesting legacies affect fire and budworm differently due to differences in forest types consumed by each disturbance. Contrary to expectation, budworm defoliation did not affect area burned at the temporal scales studied and neither amount of logging nor cutblock size influenced defoliation extent. Logging increased fire size through conversion of more of the landscape to early seral, highly flammable forest types. Although logging increased the amount of budworm host species, spruce budworm caused mortality was reduced due to reductions in forest age. In general, we found that spatial legacies do not influence all disturbances equally and the duration of a spatial legacy is limited when multiple disturbances are present. Further information on post-disturbance succession is still needed to refine our understanding of long-term disturbance interactions.",NA,NA,"2011","SPRINGER","2011 JAN","ECOSYSTEMS","14","1","60","75","10.1007/s10021-010-9395-5","1432-9840 and 1435-0629","WOS:000288172000005","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"James, Patrick M.

Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations.The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei.Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment.This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.",NA,NA,"2020","WILEY","2020 MAY","AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","30","5","1050","1060","10.1002/aqc.3324","1052-7613 and 1099-0755","WOS:000522683000001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Santoro, Anthony et al.

There is an increasing interest in extracting woody residues on clear-cuts for bioenergy production, which will further decrease dead wood amounts. Empirical studies show that such extraction decreases habitat availability for many species at a local scale, but no analyses have been made on long-term effects on population sizes and species persistence in whole landscapes. We investigated how theoretical species that differ in dispersal range, habitat specialization, and commonness are affected by different levels of wood extraction intensity. We also investigated the effect of extracting only slash (branches and tops) compared to both slash and stumps, and the spatial location of the extraction. This was done by simulations of dead wood development and species' colonization extinction dynamics based on metapopulation theory. The simulations were run for 200 years in an 11 x 11 km managed forest landscape in Sweden. For all species the predicted population sizes decreased, and for six out of eight species the landscape level extinction risks increased with increasing bioenergy extraction. The negative impacts were larger when including stumps compared to extracting slash only. However, rare species declined more strongly with increasing extraction than the common species. Specialists on coarse sun-exposed wood declined more than generalists when stumps were included in the extraction, while the pattern was the opposite when only extracting slash. The population declines continued for up to 200 years before colonizations and extinctions were in equilibrium, and were generally slower for rare compared to common species. Concentrating the extraction to 50% of the landscape had a positive effect on rare and short dispersing species, which could be assumed to be the most threatened species. Thus, bioenergy extraction is likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity, which are most severe when stumps are extracted at a high intensity throughout the landscape. Even at low levels of stump extraction, species which are already rare and specialized on sun-exposed coarse dead wood may be threatened. Slash extraction has probably less impact, since few species are specialized on fine woody debris. Concentrating the extraction to a subset of forested areas may reduce the negative impact. The apparent direct trade-off between the amount of bioenergy extracted and the remaining amount of dead-wood habitat may require that bioenergy extraction is either limited or further conservation interventions are employed that compensate for anthropogenic habitat loss.

However, biodiversity may respond slowly to habitat loss, taking time to undergo successional change following a disturbance. Despite the fact that historic processes often mediate current patterns of biodiversity, most studies focus only on contemporary factors.Our research examines how both contemporary and historic environmental factors impact current pollinator community similarity, or beta-diversity. We examine two hypotheses: H1) contemporary land-use predicts community similarity, but also that land-use history has long-lasting effects on beta-diversity; H2) the specific response to contemporary and historic environmental factors is explained by variation in pollinator species life-history traits.We sampled 36 pollinator communities over a three-year period across cotton fields varying in historic and contemporary land-use. Using multiple regression on distance matrices (MRDM), we investigate correlations between community similarity and differences in contemporary and historic environmental factors.First, we show that increased time between sampling events and the loss of semi-natural habitat over a 19-year period led to decreased community similarity. Interestingly, neither geographic distance nor contemporary environmental factors contributed to similarity. Second, we show that much of the variation in community similarity is due to variation in pollinator species life-history traits, such as foraging ability and diet breadth.Results indicate that land-use history has long-lasting effects on community composition, greater than effects exhibited by contemporary factors. These legacy effects are critical considerations for conservation as their omission may lead to overly optimistic assessments of biodiversity in recently disturbed habitats.",NA,NA,"2018","SPRINGER","2018 AUG","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY","33","8","1335","1351","10.1007/s10980-018-0668-2","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000439347700008","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Article","DORDRECHT",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cusser, Sarah et al.

Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time.2. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species.3. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30% higher (with a maximum of 150% higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances (<1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (similar to 30%).4. We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 OCT","METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","8","10","1253","1264","10.1111/2041-210X.12799","2041-210X and 2041-2096","WOS:000412858600009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Martensen, Alexandre Camargo et al.

O.","Grazing networks promote plant functional connectivity among isolated grassland communities","Aim Habitat loss threatens plant diversity globally. Lack of plant functional connectivity between isolated populations is often pinpointed as one of the major underlying mechanisms driving subsequent species extinctions. Therefore, landscape-scale conservation management promoting functional connectivity needs to be implemented urgently. Supporting the movement of seed dispersal vectors such as grazing animals may help safeguard local and regional plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. However, the efficacy of such management remains to be thoroughly assessed. Location Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We test how grazing animals may serve as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks promoting plant functional connectivity via directed seed dispersal. Using landscape genetics, we compare isolated populations of the grassland perennial Campanula rotundifolia located in either active or abandoned grazing networks, to test if spatial patterns in their genetic diversity, differentiation and allele frequencies relate to the presence or absence of connectivity via rotational grazing management. Results Grazing networks imprinted strong landscape-scale spatial patterning in pairwise population genetic differentiation and within-population genetic diversity. Isolated C. rotundifolia populations functionally connected by grazing animals held higher genetic diversity compared to populations no longer connected by grazing livestock. Gene flow linked to the directed seed dispersal was higher between populations within grazing networks, confirmed by their increased allele richness. We found a predictable, nested loss of genetic diversity among C. rotundifolia populations in abandoned grazing networks. Main conclusions Grazing animals were important seed dispersal vectors, functionally connecting isolated grassland communities, so being vital to the successful long-term persistence and conservation of not only species but also genetic diversity. Crucially, the study underlines the possibilities of using domestic livestock as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks as an effective tool to manage, conserve and restore both genetic and species diversity among isolated plant communities in fragmented landscapes.",NA,NA,"2019","WILEY","2019 JAN","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","25","1","102","115","10.1111/ddi.12842","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000455265600010","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Plue, Jan et al.

Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant-herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant-herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.",NA,NA,"2018","WILEY","2018 DEC","OIKOS","127","12","1822","1833","10.1111/oik.05052","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000451851200011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Boulangeat, Isabelle et al.

Because these ecosystems differ from others in biotic and abiotic filters, cues for plant regeneration and management derived from elsewhere may not be applicable to semiarid ecosystems. We sought to determine the extent to which regional variation in regeneration prospects of a long-lived semiarid keystone shrub depends on anthropogenic habitat degradation, plant-animal interactions and climate determinants. We investigated the regeneration ability (via population size structure, juvenile density and juvenile/adult ratio), fruit set and seed dispersal of Ziziphus lotus in 25 localities spanning the range of its threatened habitats in Spain. We dissected the relative contribution of different regeneration determinants using multiple regression and structural equationmodelling. Population regeneration was extremely poor, and size structures were biased towards large classes and low juvenile densities and juvenile/adult ratios. Poor regeneration was often coincident with seed dispersal collapse. However, the positive effect of seed dispersal on population regeneration disappeared after considering its relationship with habitat degradation. Protected areas did have juveniles. Together, these data suggest that habitat degradation directly impacts juvenile establishment. Our results provide insights into habitat and species management at the regional level. Z.lotus populations are currently driven by persistence-based dynamics through the longevity of the species. Nonetheless, collapsed seed dispersal, poor regeneration and the removal of adults from their habitats forecast extinction of Z.lotus in many remnants.

The first underpins the competition-colonization hypothesis in which early successional species are able to persist because they colonize disturbed habitats before the arrival of late successional dominant competitors. The second underpins the niche hypothesis, in which early successional species are able to persist, even with unlimited colonization by late successional dominants, because they specialize on the resource-rich conditions typical of recently disturbed sites. We modify the widely studied competition-colonization model so that it also includes the mechanism behind the niche hypothesis. Analysis of this model suggests simple experiments that determine whether the successional diversity of a field system is maintained primarily by the competition-colonization mechanism, primarily by the niche mechanism, by neither, or by both.

A number of studies concerning the effect of management on biodiversity have been conducted in the tropical and temperate forest zones. This topic is less studied in the forest steppe biome, where the reestablishment of plants from the surrounding patches is more limited than in the forest biome. Most studies compare alien plantations with seminatural forests. However, the effects of dominant tree species is mixed with the effect of the site preparation and site history in such comparisons, due to intensive site preparation in case of forest plantations.In this study, we separate the effect of these management elements. We examined the potential of currently used forestry protocol in preserving the plant biodiversity of the forest herb layer in the Pannonian sand forest steppe using 266 forest plots from the Kiskunsag sand region in Hungary. The total richness and richness of habitat preference groups (forest specialists, grassland specialists, native weeds, and aliens) were compared in natural and plantation forests of different tree species to explore the effects of dominant tree species and site preparation on the species composition. Factors determining the richness of forest specialists in plantations were analyzed by fitting a regression tree, and the habitat preference of these species was described by their fidelity to the forest types.Our results show that total species richness is less sensitive to management than the richness of some species groups with a specific habitat preference. Forest specialist species can survive almost only in continuous seminatural oak forests, that is, in forests that are continuously present and do not undergo any site preparation. They are completely missing from young plantations, most likely because site preparation completely removes them. Their limited recolonization is possible only in plantations of native trees in landscapes where seminatural oak forests have been continuously present. Even under these conditions, only half of the forest specialist species are able to recolonize in the plantations. Grassland specialists, on the other hand, are present in every forest type but with low richness. Site preparation acts as a colonization window for weeds and aliens. However, while the richness of weeds is the highest in young plantations and decreases in established plantations, probably due to the canopy closing, the richness of aliens is the same in both young and established plantations.Considering our results, the current forestry protocol is hardly suitable for maintaining the plant biodiversity of forests in the forest steppe zone, therefore, management practices should be changed to focus more on the conservation of these endangered habitats.",NA,NA,"2020","ELSEVIER","2020 APR 1","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","461",NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.117964","0378-1127 and 1872-7042","WOS:000518873600034","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Article","AMSTERDAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Redei, Tamas et al.

Recent studies have documented the high levels of biodiversity-across many taxa and biomes-that agricultural landscapes can support over the short term(1,3,4). However, little is known about the long-term effects of alternative agricultural practices on ecological communities(4,5) Here we document changes in bird communities in intensive-agriculture, diversified-agriculture and natural-forest habitats in 4 regions of Costa Rica over a period of 18 years.

For example, smaller ponds are at greater risk in a drying climate and their loss would remove any obligate aquatic individuals present. We asked what proportional loss of species diversity from metacommunities comprised of discrete habitat patches should be expected from attrition (complete loss) of only the smallest patches under such a premise. We analyzed 175 published datasets for different taxonomic groups (vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants) and habitat types (islands, habitat islands, and fragments). We simulated the destruction of only the smallest patches to an approximate 20% of total area (range: 15.2%-24.2%) and analyzed species loss. Mean [+/- 95% CI] species loss was 12.7% [10.8, 14.6], although 18.3% of datasets lost no species. Four broad patterns of species loss were evident, reflecting underlying differences in minimum area requirements and the degree of species turnover among patches. Regression modeling showed species loss increased with greater species turnover among patches (beta(SIM)) and decreased with greater area scaling of diversity (i.e., larger power-law island species-area relationship exponents). Losses also increased with greater numbers of single-patch endemics and with increasing proportions of patches destroyed. After accounting for these predictors, neither taxonomic group nor habitat type increased explained variation in species loss. Attrition of the smallest patches removed species in >80% of metacommunities, despite all larger patches and >75% of total area remaining intact. At both 10% and 20% area reduction, median species loss across all datasets was around 50% higher than predicted from methods based on the species-area relationship.

White-tailed deer are a problematic herbivore throughout much of eastern North America and alter forest understory community structure. Reducing (by culling) or eliminating (by fencing) deer herbivory is expected to return understory vegetation to a previously diverse condition. We examined this assumption from 1992 to 2006 at Fermilab (Batavia, IL) where a cull reduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance in 1998/1999 by 90% from 24.6 to 2.5/km(2), and at West Point, NY, where we assessed interactive effects of deer, earthworms, and invasive plants using 30 x 30 m paired fenced and open plots in 12 different forests from 2009 to 2012. We recorded not only plant community responses (species presence and cover) within 1 m(2) quadrats, but also responses of select individual species (growth, reproduction). At Fermilab, introduced Alliaria petiolata abundance initially increased as deer density increased, but then declined after deer reduction. The understory community responded to the deer cull by increased cover, species richness and height, and community composition changed but was dominated by early successional native forbs. At West Point plant community composition was affected by introduced earthworm density but not deer exclusion. Native plant cover increased and non-native plant cover decreased in fenced plots, thus keeping overall plant cover similar. At both sites native forb cover increased in response to deer reduction, but the anticipated response of understory vegetation failed to materialize at the community level. Deer-favoured forbs (Eurybia divaricata, Maianthemum racemosum, Polygonatum pubescens and Trillium recurvatum) grew taller and flowering probability increased in the absence of deer. Plant community monitoring fails to capture initial and subtle effects of reduced or even cessation of deer browse on browse sensitive species.

In particular in temperate grasslands changes in land use and its consequences, i.e. increasing fragmentation, the on-going loss of habitat and the declining importance of regional processes such as seed dispersal by livestock, are considered key drivers of the diversity loss witnessed within the last decades.It is a largely unresolved question to what degree current temperate grassland communities already reflect a decline of regional processes such as longer distance seed dispersal. Answering this question is challenging since it requires both a mechanistic approach to community dynamics and a sufficient data basis that allows identifying general patterns. Here, we present results of a local individual- and trait-based community model that was initialized with plant functional types (PFTs) derived from an extensive empirical data set of species-rich grasslands within the 'Biodiversity Exploratories' in Germany. Driving model processes included above- and belowground competition, dynamic resource allocation to shoots and roots, clonal growth, grazing, and local seed dispersal. To test for the impact of regional processes we also simulated seed input from a regional species pool. Model output, with and without regional seed input, was compared with empirical community response patterns along a grazing gradient. Simulated response patterns of changes in PFT richness, Shannon diversity, and biomass production matched observed grazing response patterns surprisingly well if only local processes were considered. Already low levels of additional regional seed input led to stronger deviations from empirical community pattern. While these findings cannot rule out that regional processes other than those considered in the modeling study potentially play a role in shaping the local grassland communities, our comparison indicates that European grasslands are largely isolated, i.e. local mechanisms explain observed community patterns to a large extent.",NA,NA,"2014","WILEY","2014 MAY","OIKOS","123","5","599","612","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00957.x","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000334646100011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Weiss, Lina et al.

We link local population dynamics within a heterogeneous, fragmented landscape context. ""Species spheres"", i.e. multi-dimensional parameter ranges rather than single parameter realizations, based on field and literature data served as proxy for life stage transition parameters. Four climatic scenarios summarizing different cumulative weather effects on demographic rates and different local disturbance frequencies were run. The model predicts ""time to extinction"" (TE) and ""proportion of occupied habitat"" (POH) as regional indicators for species extinction risk.ResultsTE decreased for all species when weather conditions worsened, and even more so when the frequency of local destructive events additionally increased. However, management towards fewer disturbance events could buffer the negative effect of climate to some extent. The magnitude of these responses varied with species type. POH declined with an increase in bad weather as well as with increasing disturbance frequency. The better the climatic conditions, the less severe were disturbances on population performance.ConclusionsThe ""species spheres"" proved to be a valuable approach for predictive trends. As climate change usually also implies destructive events such as land-use change, flooding or fire, our model on local and regional extinction risks can support conservation issues and management actions.",NA,NA,"2010","WILEY","2010 OCT","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE","21","5","843","856","10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01191.x","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000281551000004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Koerner, Katrin et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Byers, JE and Goldwasser, L","Exposing the mechanism and timing of impact of nonindigenous species on native species","The nonnative mudsnail Batillaria attramentaria was introduced to the west coast of North America in the early part of this century and has been displacing the native mudsnail Cerithidea californica on a marsh-by-marsh basis. We combined detailed, quantitative field data on this invader and its interactions with the native snail in an individual-based model that allowed us to address both general questions about the mechanism of displacement of native species and more specific concerns about detecting the trajectory and impact of the invasion. In empirically parameterized simulations the native snail was driven extinct within 55-70 yr after introduction of Batillaria, which closely matches direct field estimates. We then tested the relative importance of Batillaria's demonstrated advantages in parasitism resistance (top-down effect), exploitative competition (bottom-up effect), and mortality rate (demographic advantage) in driving its displacement of Cerithidea. With its demographic advantage maintained, but without its advantages in competition and parasitism, Batillaria still drove Cerithidea extinct within 90 yr. Only when Batillaria's mortality rate was set equal to that of Cerithidea could the native snail persist indefinitely, demonstrating this factor's overwhelming influence on the success of this invasion. The difference in mortality between the species was large relative to the other differences, but further simulations showed that the importance of this difference stems not just from its magnitude, but also from the sensitivity of this system to this demographic rate. Identification of the relative importance of mechanisms that contribute to an invader's success is one of the major benefits of such modeling efforts.To identify empirically measurable quantities that provide the earliest warning of impact on the native species, we tracked many population- and individual-level responses of Cerithidea to Batillaria's invasion, including population density, biomass, egg production, mean size, proportion of infected individuals, and individual growth rate, as well as availability of shared food resources. We used the empirically observed parameter values and an initial number of Batillaria invaders in these: simulations that guaranteed extinction of Cerithidea within 90 yr. Despite a rapid initial increase in invader populations, all metrics for Cerithidea were slow to exhibit signs of impact. Most took at least 25 yr from invasion to exhibit detectable changes, by which time the nonnative species was established at high densities (> 3000 snails/m(2)). Cerithidea egg production was the fastest, most consistent response metric exhibiting declines within 20-25 yr after invasion in similar to 90% of simulations. Difficulty in finding reliable, early warning metrics has crucial implications for how we should view and conduct monitoring programs and risk assessment analyses.",NA,NA,"2001","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2001 MAY","ECOLOGY","82","5","1330","1343","10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1330:ETMATO]2.0.CO;2","0012-9658","WOS:000168844200011","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Byers, JE et al.

J.","Keeping pace with climate change: what can we learn from the spread of Lessepsian migrants?","Species need to move to keep pace with changing climates, but we do not know if species can move at the required speed. Spread rates of native species may underestimate how fast species can move, we therefore assessed how fast Lessepsian species (marine non-native species that invaded the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal) can spread to give a best-case assessment of the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity. We show that about 20% of Lessepsian species could not spread fast enough to keep pace with climate change in about 20% of the global seas and this suggests that climate change may lead to biodiversity loss. The velocity of climate change on the seabed is much lower than at the sea surface, and as a result of this the proportion of species that keep pace with climate change at the seabed was much larger than at the sea surface. This suggests that locations at depth could act as refuges for slow dispersing species. Our analysis compared different estimates of the spreading abilities of marine species and showed that the estimate of spread rates strongly affects the predicted effect of climate change on biodiversity. Providing more accurate estimates of the spreading ability of marine species should therefore have priority if we want to predict the effect of climate change on marine biodiversity. This study is a first approximation of the potential scale and distribution of global marine biodiversity loss and can provide benchmark estimates of the spread rates that species could achieve in colonizing suitable habitat.

"JOUR",NA,"Labandeira, Conrad C.","Deep-time patterns of tissue consumption by terrestrial arthropod herbivores","A survey of the fossil record of land-plant tissues and their damage by arthropods reveals several results that shed light on trophic trends in host-plant resource use by arthropods. All 14 major plant tissues were present by the end of the Devonian, representing the earliest 20 % of the terrestrial biota. During this interval, two types of time lags separate the point between when tissues first originated from their earliest consumption by herbivorous arthropods. For epidermis, parenchyma, collenchyma and xylem, live tissue consumption was rapid, occurring on average 10 m.y. after the earliest tissue records. By contrast, structural tissues (periderm, sclerenchyma), tissues with actively dividing cells (apical, lateral, intercalary meristems), and reproductive tissues (spores, megagametophytes, integuments) experienced approximately a 9-fold (92 m.y.) delay in arthropod herbivory, extending well into the Carboniferous Period. Phloem similarly presents a delay of 85 m.y., but this incongruously long lag-time may be attributed to the lack of preservation of this tissue in early vascular plants. Nevertheless, the presence of phloem can be indicated from planar spaces adjacent well-preserved xylem, or inferred from a known anatomy of the same plant taxon in better preserved material, especially permineralisations. The trophic partitioning of epidermis, parenchyma, phloem and xylem increases considerably to the present, probably a consequence of dietary specialization or consumption of whole leaves by several herbivore functional feeding groups. Structural tissues, meristematic tissues and reproductive tissues minimally have been consumed throughout the fossil record, consistent with their long lags to herbivory during the earlier Paleozoic. Neither angiosperm dominance in floras nor global environmental perturbations had any discernible effect on herbivore trophic partitioning of plant tissues.",NA,NA,"2013","SPRINGER","2013 APR","NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN","100","4","355","364","10.1007/s00114-013-1035-4","0028-1042 and 1432-1904","WOS:000317348600007","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Article","NEW YORK",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Labandeira, Conrad C.

The aim of the present study is to make an inventory of medium and large mammal species in a Cerrado remnant and to assess deforestation influence on part of this fragment on the richness and composition of mammal species. The study was conducted in a Cerrado fragment in southeast Goias State, Ipameri County. Data were collected during three different periods (P1, January-June, 2014; P2, December, 2016 - June, 2017; P3, July-December, 2017) through direct (visual, vocal and camera-trap records) and indirect methods (foot prints, animal burrows and other traces) in order to register the mammal species. Jackknife 1 estimator was used to estimate species richness during each of the three sampled periods and for the complete collection period; species similarity between periods was assessed through the Jaccard's Index of Similarity (Cj). Species richness between periods was performed through inference by overlapping confidence intervals (CI). Twenty-nine species were recorded during the assessed period, five of them were listed as endangered in Brazil. There was no significant change in species richness between the assessed periods: species richness of 25 species was observed in Period 1 (P1), the richness of 32 species was estimated (CI = 4.58); 23 species were recorded in Period 2 (P2), and the richness of 30 species was estimated (CI = 4.39), the richness of 23 species was observed in Period 3 (P3) and the richness of 28 species was estimated (CI = 4.70). Similarity in species composition between the assessed periods recorded Cj = 0.71 (71%) between P1 and P2, Cj = 0.66 (66%) between P1 and P3, and Cj = 0.77 between P2 and P3. Fragment deforestation did not influence the richness and composition of medium and large mammal species (within a period of 2 similar to 3 years) when the three periods were compared; however, the absence of changes in the community can be the result of time-lag, therefore, we cannot put aside the likelihood of mid and long-term effects.",NA,NA,"2019","REVISTA BIOTA NEOTROPICA","2019","BIOTA NEOTROPICA","19","3",NA,NA,"10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2018-0671","1676-0603","WOS:000473537700001","AV.

Our current understanding of the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation is based largely on studies that focus on either short-term or long-term responses. Short-term responses are often used to predict long-term responses and make management decisions. The lack of studies comparing short-and long-term responses to fragmentation means we do not adequately understand when and how well short-term responses can be extrapolated to predict long-term responses, and when or why they cannot. To address this gap, we used data from one of the world's longest-running fragmentation experiments, The Wog Wog Habitat Fragmentation Experiment. Using data for carabid beetles, we found that responses in the long term (more than 22 yr post-fragmentation approximate to 22 generations) often contrasted markedly with those in the short term (5 yr post-fragmentation). The total abundance of all carabids, species richness and the occurrence of six species declined in the short term in the fragments but increased over the long term. The occurrence of three species declined initially and continued to decline, whilst another species was positively affected initially but decreased in the long term. Species' responses to the matrix that surrounds the fragments strongly predicted both the direction (increase/decline in occurrence) and magnitude of their responses to fragmentation. Additionally, species' responses to the matrix were somewhat predicted by their preferences for different types of native habitat (open vs. shaded). Our study highlights the degree of the matrix's influence in fragmented landscapes, and how this influence can change over time. We urge caution in using short-term responses to forecast long-term responses in cases where the matrix (1) impacts species' responses to fragmentation (by isolating them, creating new habitat or altering fragment habitat) and (2) is likely to change through time.",NA,NA,"2017","WILEY","2017 MAR","ECOLOGY","98","3","807","819","10.1002/ecy.1704","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000395824000021","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Evans, Maldwyn J. et al.

Given the temporal variability inherent in many ecosystems, long-term studies are important to understand how species respond to landscape change. We revisited a large-scale, natural experiment, 10years after initial surveys to investigate the response of arboreal marsupials to anthropogenic landscape change over time.LocationThe Tumut Fragmentation Study in south-eastern Australia encompasses 50,000ha of contiguous Eucalyptus forests and eucalypt forest remnants surrounded by an exotic pine (Pinus radiata) plantation.MethodsThis study followed an established, statistically rigorous, replicated design that matched remnant eucalypt sites within the plantation to control sites within contiguous eucalypt forests. We recorded the presence and abundance of arboreal marsupials by spotlighting along transects. We used a range of generalized linear models to investigate interactions among independent and dependent variables and test hypotheses established at the outset of the study.ResultsAll of the species observed in eucalypt remnants in 1996 were present in 2007. However, the presence and abundance of some species had changed significantly between periods. Remnant size, isolation, the disturbance history of the pine matrix adjoining remnants, time since pine establishment, and/or the age of the pines were significant factors in explaining the presence and abundance of some species. We identify mechanistic processes that may be responsible for the differing response patterns of the four most common arboreal marsupial species.Main conclusionsMost native forest remnants continued to provide habitat for several arboreal marsupial species over the past decade. These results add considerable weight to recommendations calling for the preservation of native forests remnants during and after plantation establishment. The condition and management of the matrix can significantly affect wildlife populations in modified landscapes, and this should be given more consideration in conservation planning.

North central Victoria - climate change and land-use: potentials for third century in a timeless land. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria 122(2): 161-183. ISSN 0035-9211.For the 21st century, scenarios of future climate under global warming suggest that I3assian-Eyrean bioclimatic region of northern Victoria, centred on the North Cen::ral Catchment Management Authority (NCCMA), will become markedly warmer and drier. Significant c imate change is a real possibility midcentury and some basic bio-physical attributes underpinning the curent ecology, land-use and management will be altered. Societal adaptation to climate change will include enhancing landscape resilience and changes to the mix of inter-related ecosystem services. The incree.sing understanding of these inter-relationships will allow for the creation of a more holistic quantification and production of landscape services. In combination, these challenge the past land-use paradigm on the driest, inhabited continent. Following the mid-I9th century gold rushes, land-use in the NCCMA represented the epitome of the colonial land-use paradigm through clearing for agriculture and pastoralism. Victor:a has long had the highest percentage private land of any Australian state. The NCCMA catchment is the most denuded of native vegetation, with the smallest percentage of public land and conservation reserves, and is now the centre of a continental concentration of bioregions under high environmental stress. The original primacy of agriculture was fulfilled, sometimes under adverse circumstances, but resultant landscape legacies persist within the relative economic decline of Australian agriculture. The amelioration of these within a future land stewardship that is water-stressed, carbon constrained and prone to extreme weather events is a major challenge. Exploring landscape adaptation, the simple questions arise: From what? To what? This contribution examines broad land-use in the NCCMA in the long term context of climate change and adaptation, land-use and the perceived valuation of ecosystem services from the landscape. The increasing realisation of the interconnectedness of these phenomena and the necessity for ecologically sustainable agriculture provide enhanced drivers for the evolution of new landscape meanings in the context of an inter-generational equity and climate change response.",NA,NA,"2010",NA,"2010","Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria","122","2","161","183",NA,"0035-9211 and 2204-1362","BCI:BCI201100238402",NA,"Article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mansergh, Ian (2010) North Central Victoria - Climate Change and Land-Use: Potentials for Third Century in a Timeless Land. <i>Jour</i>.

Forest management objectives that include specific forest age structure may not be easily attained due to constraints imposed by the legacies of historical management and natural disturbance. We used a spatially explicit stochastic model to explore the synergetic effects of forest management and fire on boreal forest age structure. Specifically, we examined (1) the duration of spatial legacies of different management practices in the boreal forest, (2) how multiple shifts in management practices affect legacy duration and the spatial trajectories of forest age structure, and (3) how fire influences legacy duration and pattern development in combination with harvesting. Results based on 30 replicates of 500 years for each scenario indicate that (1) spatial legacies persist over 200 years and the rate at which legacies are overcome depends on whether new management targets are in synchrony with existing spatial pattern; (2) age specific goals were met faster after multiple management shifts due to the similar spatial scale of the preceding management types; (3) because large fires can erase the spatial pattern created by smaller disturbances, scenarios with fire had shorter lags than scenarios without fire. These results suggest that forest management goals can be accelerated by applying management at a similar spatial scale as existing spatial patterns.

"JOUR",NA,"Rudolphi, Jorgen and Jonsson, Mari T. and Gustafsson, Lena","Biological legacies buffer local species extinction after logging","Clearcutting has been identified as a main threat to forest biodiversity. In the last few decades, alternatives to clearcutting have gained much interest. Living and dead trees are often retained after harvest to serve as structural legacies to mitigate negative effects of forestry. However, this practice is widely employed without information from systematic before-after control-impact studies to assess the processes involved in species responses after clearcutting with retention. We performed a large-scale survey of the occurrence of logging-sensitive and red-listed bryophytes and lichens before and after clearcutting with the retention approach. A methodology was adopted that, for the first time in studies on retention approaches, enabled monitoring of location-specific substrates. We used uncut stands as controls to assess the variables affecting the survival of species after a major disturbance. In total, 12 bryophyte species and 27 lichen species were analysed. All were classified as sensitive to logging, and most species are also currently red-listed. We found that living and dead trees retained after final harvest acted as refugia in which logging-sensitive species were able to survive for 3 to 7years after logging. Depending on type of retention and organism group, between 35% and 92% of the species occurrences persisted on retained structures. Most species observed outside retention trees or patches disappeared. Larger pre-harvest population sizes of bryophytes on dead wood increased the survival probability of the species and hence buffered the negative effects of logging.Synthesis and applications. Careful spatial planning of retention structures is required to fully embrace the habitats of logging-sensitive species. Bryophytes and lichens persisted to a higher degree in retention patches compared to solitary trees or in the clearcut area. Retaining groups of trees in logged areas will help to sustain populations of species over the clearcut phase. When possible, old logs should be moved into retention patches to provide a more beneficial environment for dead wood-dependent species. Our study also highlights the need for more before-after control-impact studies of retention forestry to explore factors influencing the survival of species after logging.Careful spatial planning of retention structures is required to fully embrace the habitats of logging-sensitive species.

We investigated the response ofyfynbos-typical avifauna to fragmentation and postfire vegetation age in order to better understand the consequences of these processes for bird communities. Vegetation composition and bird inventory data were collected along wandering transects in three South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos habitat configurations: fragmented patches (associated with anthropogenically driven habitat loss < 150 years ago), naturally isolated fynbos islands (formed through climate-driven forest expansion in the Holocene) and extensive areas of relatively pristine habitat known as 'mainland'. The latter configurations served as references against which to investigate bird and vegetation responses to more recent habitat fragmentation. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships of a number of bird and plant species to areas between each habitat configuration. Bird attribute frequency data were compared between habitat configurations using chi-square tests. Birds and plants showed significant species-area relationships in natural island and mainland sites, but no such relationship occurred in artificial fragments for birds, where the surrounding anthropogenic land uses are likely to have contributed generalist or colonist species. Avifaunal migratory groups were not affected by isolation distances of > 10 km in this study and their frequencies were the same across the three habitat configurations. Certain feeding guilds did, however, respond to postfire vegetation age, with nectarivore species twice as likely to occur in old-growth mainland fynbos. Fragmentation can alter fire disturbance regimes, which in turn alter the availability of resources in a habitat, so the impacts of fragmentation on birds are probably indirect through changes in the vegetation component.Conservation implications: Fragments of South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos have value as resource refugia and 'stepping-stone' reserves for avifauna. Fragments should be managed for vegetation age to ensure that at least some patches sustain high levels of nectar-producing plant species.

Todd","Under siege: Isolated tributaries are threatened by regionally impaired metacommunities","Pristine streams are often targeted as conservation priorities because of their ability to preserve regional biodiversity. However, isolation within heavily degraded regions likely alters important metapopulation and metacommunity processes (e.g., rescue and mass effects), affecting the ability of in-tact communities to boost regional conditions. To test this hypothesis, we sampled invertebrate communities and physicochemical conditions from 168 streams within the mountaintop removal-valley fill mining region of West Virginia. We used redundancy analysis to first test for significant effects of local (observed physicochemical conditions) and neighborhood (streams within a 5 km buffer) degradation on assemblage structure across all taxa and stress tolerance (low, moderate, high) and dispersal (low, high) categories. We then used generalized linear and hurdle models to characterize changes in community metrics and individual taxa, respectively. Local condition consistently explained the majority of variation (partial R-2 up to 5x those of neighborhood condition) in community structure and was the only factor affecting sensitive taxa. Neighborhood condition explained significant variation in moderately tolerant taxa with low dispersal capacity and highly tolerant taxa, regardless of dispersal. Decreased occurrence (Baetis) and abundance (Maccaffertium) of key taxa and corresponding metrics (%E, %EPT) suggest decreased dispersal and associated mass and rescue effects within degraded neighborhoods. Decreased neighborhood conditions also resulted in the proliferation of tolerant taxa (Chironomidae, Chimarra, Hemerodromia). Our results suggest communities within even the most pristine streams are at risk when isolated within heavily impacted regions.

Furthermore, we calculated similarity in species composition between 10 km x 10 km grid cells to evaluate changes in assemblage composition (i.e. biotic homogenization) of butterflies through space and time. Trends were evaluated for all butterflies as well as for three functional groups, using hierarchical clustering and species-specific values of eight ecological traits.Results We document severe declines in butterfly diversity over the last century, with substantial regional-scale extinctions leading to a net loss of 10% of all Danish butterfly species. Segregating species into functional groups showed that the highest rate of regional extinction occurred among sedentary habitat specialists overwintering in the egg stage, while the most severe local-scale declines occurred among sedentary host plant specialists overwintering in the larval stage. In contrast, mobile generalist species with mature overwintering stages showed stable richness trends throughout the century. However, a pervasive spatio-temporal biotic homogenization of butterfly assemblages was revealed for all functional groups.Main conclusions Our results suggest that observed changes in species richness were driven by a gradual replacement of ecological specialists by broadly adapted ecological generalists. In addition to drawing attention to a severe long-term impoverishment of the Danish butterfly fauna, our results suggest that trajectories of butterfly species richness and assemblage composition over the last century are related to multiple functional traits, highlighting the need to consider different aspects of ecological specialization when assessing extinction risk.",NA,NA,"2015","WILEY-BLACKWELL","2015 JUL","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","21","7","792","802","10.1111/ddi.12340","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000357812400006","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Eskildsen, Anne et al.

"JOUR",NA,"van Strien, Arco J. and van Swaay, Chris A. M. and Kery, Marc","Metapopulation dynamics in the butterfly Hipparchia semele changed decades before occupancy declined in The Netherlands","The survival of many species in human-dominated, fragmented landscapes depends on metapopulation dynamics, i.e., on a dynamic equilibrium of extinctions and colonizations in patches of suitable habitat. To understand and predict distributional changes, knowledge of these dynamics can be essential, and for this, metapopulation studies are preferably based on long-time-series data from many sites. Alas, such data are very scarce. An alternative is to use opportunistic data (i.e., collected without applying standardized field methods), but these data suffer from large variations in field methods and search intensity between sites and years. Dynamic site-occupancy models offer a general approach to adjust for variable survey effort. These models extend classical metapopulation models to account for imperfect detection of species and yield estimates of the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, and survival of species at sites. By accounting for detection, they fully correct for among-year variability in search effort.As an illustration, we fitted a dynamic site-occupancy model to 60 years of presence-absence data (more precisely, detection-nondetection) of the heathland butterfly Hipparchia semele in The Netherlands. Detection records were obtained from a database containing volunteer-based data from 1950-2009, and nondetection records were deduced from database records of other butterfly species. Our model revealed that metapopulation dynamics of Hipparchia had changed decades before the species' distribution began to contract. Colonization probability had already started to decline from 1950 onward, but this was counterbalanced by an increase in the survival of existing populations, the result of which was a stable distribution. Only from 1990 onward was survival not sufficient to compensate for the further decrease of colonization, and occupancy started to decline. Hence, it appears that factors acting many decades ago triggered a change in the metapopulation dynamics of this species, which ultimately led to a severe decline in occupancy that only became apparent much later. Our study emphasizes the importance of knowledge of changes in survival and colonization of species in modern landscapes over a very long time scale. It also demonstrates the power of site-occupancy modeling to obtain important population dynamics information from databases containing opportunistic sighting records.",NA,NA,"2011","WILEY","2011 OCT","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS","21","7","2510","2520","10.1890/10-1786.1","1051-0761 and 1939-5582","WOS:000296139200014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Article","HOBOKEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"van Strien, Arco J. et al.

"JOUR",NA,"Pearman, PB","The scale of community structure: Habitat variation and avian guilds in tropical forest understory","Both local and regional habitat characteristics influence species richness and community structure. The scale at which communities are studied, however, affects the detection of relationships between habitat characteristics and patterns of habitat selection, species diversity, and species composition, and may obscure observation of differences in how species perceive the scale of environmental variation. To determine how environmental variation at different scales is related to species occurrence and richness, I analyze mist net sampling data on several guilds of forest understory birds. Bird capture, vegetation, and physical environment data come from 23 0.5-ha study sites in primary and secondary forest in Amazonian Ecuador. The percentages of primary forest within concentric circles around each site form forest imbeddedness measures (FIMs), which are evaluated using satellite imagery. Variation in FIM size represents different measurement scales for determining forest cover. Primary forest cover is also analyzed in successively larger tori surrounding sites and is used, after variable reduction with Principal Components Analysis, to summarize variation in forest cover around sites. Linear regression, surface trend analysis, and ordination help to quantify how variation in guild composition and species richness is explained by forest cover, vegetation structure, and physical environment.Species composition is related to variation in primary forest cover, primarily within 200-600 m of study sites. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates that nectarivores, shrub-layer frugivores, and ant-following birds are captured in areas with relatively low primary forest cover. In contrast. shrub-layer insectivores, shrub-layer omnivores, and birds probing dead foliage for large insects tend to be captured in areas of relatively high primary forest cover. The species richness of insect gleaners, ant followers, and omnivores is statistically related to the percent cover of primary forest within hundreds of meters from the study sites. This suggests that some mechanisms that influence guild composition act over substantial distances. Nonetheless, the small radii of FIMs related to the species richness of dead-leaf probers suggests that local conditions and variation in forest cover over short (<200 m) distances directly or indirectly influence species richness of some primary forest birds. The significant relationship between temperature variation among capture sites and species richness of ant-following birds suggests that these species choose among habitats in a temperature range at which physiological constraints operate, either directly on the birds themselves or on the ants they follow. Species richness within the nectarivores, in contrast, shows no relationship with large-scale variation in primary forest cover.The radius of the FIM most closely associated with species richness differs among guilds, which suggests variation in the scale at which forest cover is associated with guild structure, as well as variation in the strength of the association. Differences in the scale of relationships between environment and species richness among guilds suggest that the mechanisms that influence both species' habitat use and community structure differ among guilds. A single mechanism, operating at a single scale, is inconsistent with these patterns. Independent data from eight additional sites suggest that prediction of species richness from surrounding forest structure could be useful for managing human impacts on tropical avian communities.",NA,NA,"2002","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2002 FEB","ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS","72","1","19","39","10.1890/0012-9615(2002)072[0019:TSOCSH]2.0.CO;2","0012-9615 and 1557-7015","WOS:000173435500002","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Article","WASHINGTON",NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Pearman, PB (2002) The Scale of Community Structure: Habitat Variation and Avian Guilds in Tropical Forest Understory. <i>Jour</i>.

This is the first report of molecular cloning and characterization of RGLs in turfgrass species. Degenerate primers were designed from the conserved motifs and amplified fragments of expected size were isolated and cloned. Sequence analysis of clones and analysis of probable translation products revealed that all encoded amino acid sequences were highly conserved among the warm season turfgrass species studied, and shared the same conserved motifs found in the cloned plant disease resistance gene RPM1, Mla, and Xa1.

DNA sequence analysis revealed the present of the open reading frame (ORF) of 1,167 bp, encoding a polypeptide with 388-amino-acid with a molecular mass of 42,695 Da. The CgGPD did not exhibit significant sequence similarity with others described in other eukaryotic systems by comparative analysis. However, it consisted of two typical functional domains which belong to almost all eukaryotic GPDs: a co-enzyme binding domain in the N-terminal, and a catalytic domain. Moreover, some relevant features involved in initiation, regulation and stress response element of gene transcription were observed in the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-non-coding regions.

This is despite there being a relatively high prevalence of diadromous species relying on free access between marine and freshwater environments to complete their life cycles. With an emphasis on New Zealand experiences, this paper discusses some of the challenges associated with transferring knowledge and methods from the Northern Hemisphere, and highlights the need for novel approaches for progressing fish passage research in the Southern Hemisphere. One of the most significant challenges is that many Southern Hemisphere fish species undertake their main upstream migrations as small bodied juveniles that range in size from 15-60 mm. This precludes the use of most state-of-the-art biotelemetry methods (e.g. PIT and acoustic tagging) for studying behavior, because tags are too large. It also means there is a need for greater focus on the impact of small instream structures, e.g. culverts, on connectivity. A further constraint is that the fundamental ecology and basic swimming capabilities of many Southern Hemisphere fish species are poorly understood, limiting the ability to establish whether existing solutions are transferable. The unique behavior of some Southern Hemisphere species (e.g. the ability to climb wet surfaces) opens up new avenues of fish passage research and a need for innovative approaches to finding solutions. To maximize these opportunities there is a need to embrace inter-disciplinary approaches and improve knowledge sharing.",NA,NA,"2016","UNIV MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE SCH ENGINEERING","2016","11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ECOHYDRAULICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"978-0-7340-5339-8","WOS:000401732900069","ENGINEERING BLOCKS B, C & D, PARKVILLE, 3010 VIC, AUSTRALIA","Proceedings Paper","PARKVILLE",NA,"11th International Symposium on Ecohydraulics",NA,"Webb, JA and Costelloe, JF and CasasMulet, R and Lyon, JP and Stewardson, MJ","lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Franklin, Paul et al.
