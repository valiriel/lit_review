However, these ecosystems have suffered from fragmentation and destruction during the last century. We studied the response of calcareous grassland plant diversity to landscape changes in Belgium. Results indicated that high area loss (since 1965) old habitat patches exhibited an extinction debt inverse to low area loss old habitat patches, little depending on the area loss threshold (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%) considered for the distinction between the high and low area loss patches. However, human activities also created new habitat patches in the landscape and therefore provided opportunities for calcareous grassland plant species to colonize new habitats. This also provided opportunities to study species colonization abilities in the context of habitat restoration. We analyzed species richness in new patches compared to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. We detected the presence of a colonization credit in new patches when using high loss old patches (area loss>80%, exhibiting an extinction debt) or all old patches as a reference. However, when the reference was low loss old patches alone (area loss<80%, less likely to exhibit an extinction debt), no colonization credit was detected. In addition, species composition was similar between new patches and old patches. These results are encouraging for restoration programs. However, the results indicated that the presence of an extinction debt in reference habitats could lead to inaccurate conclusions in restoration monitoring. Therefore, extinction debt should be considered when choosing reference habitats to evaluate restoration success. ; Peer reviewed","Belgium ; Calcareous grassland ; Colonization credit ; Extinction debt ; Vascular plants ; Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-011-9611-5",2011,"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2011 JUL","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY",26,"6","823","836","10.1007/s10980-011-9611-5","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000291485400005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Piqueray, Julien et al.

For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in 'extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and 'colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.","CLIMATE-CHANGE ; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS ; VEGETATION STRUCTURE ; MODELS ; FOREST ; BIODIVERSITY ; PERSPECTIVE ; THRESHOLDS ; DIVERSITY ; DYNAMICS","https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/publications/extinction-debt-and-colonization-credit-delay-range-shifts-of-eastern-north-american-trees(4788d867-b614-465b-9d20-f45cd3777806).html",2017,"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2017 JUL","NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION",1,"7",NA,NA,"10.1038/s41559-017-0182","2397-334X","WOS:000417179000011","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Talluto, Matthew V. et al.

"ref_006","JOUR",NA,"Kitzes, Justin and Harte, John","Predicting extinction debt from community patterns","Abstract ; A significant challenge in both measuring and predicting species extinction rates at global and local scales is the possibility of extinction debt, time-delayed extinctions that occur gradually following an initial impact. Here we examine how relative abundance distributions and spatial aggregation combine to influence the likely magnitude of future extinction debt following habitat loss or climate-driven range contraction. Our analysis is based on several fundamental premises regarding abundance distributions, most importantly that species abundances immediately following habitat loss are a sample from an initial relative abundance distribution and that the long-term, steady-state form of the species abundance distribution is a property of the biology of a community and not of area. Under these two hypotheses, the results show that communities following canonical lognormal and broken-stick abundance distributions are prone to exhibit extinction debt, especially when species exhibit low spatial aggregation. Conversely, communities following a logseries distribution with a constant Fisher's Î± parameter never demonstrate extinction debt and often show an â€œimmigration credit,â€ in which species richness rises in the long term following an initial decrease. An illustration of these findings in 25 biodiversity hotspots suggests a negligible immediate extinction rate for bird communities and eventual extinction debts of 30â€“50% of initial species richness, whereas plant communities are predicted to immediately lose 5â€“15% of species without subsequent extinction debt. These results shed light on the basic determinants of extinction debt and provide initial indications of the magnitude of likely debts in landscapes where few empirical data are available.","Environmental Science ; Ecology","https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.C.3307872.V1",2016,"Figshare","2015 AUG","ECOLOGY",96,"8","2127","2136","10.1890/14-1594.1","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000358454500011","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kitzes, Justin et al.

The magnitude of these processes and their causes remain largely unknown. We explored the extinction debt and colonization credit for grassland and forest specialist plants, respectively, and the local and landscape factors associated to the richness of these species groups in a 50-year process of forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean grasslands. A set of sampling plots of persistent grasslands and forests and their transitional habitat (wooded grasslands) was selected within fixed-area sites distributed across the landscape. Our results confirm the extinction debt and suggest colonization credit (according to observed trends and model predictions) in wooded grasslands when compared to persistent forests, despite wooded grasslands and persistent forests having similar tree cover. Grassland connectivity and solar radiation had opposing effects on the richness of both grassland and forest specialists, and it is possible that the availability of seed sources from old forests may have accelerate the payment of colonization credit in the wooded grasslands. These results suggest that extinction debt and colonization credit have driven species turnover during the 50 years of forest encroachment, but at different rates, and that local and landscape factors have opposing effects on these two phenomena. They also highlight the importance of documenting biodiversity time lags following habitat change when they are still in progress in order to timely and adequately manage habitats of high conservation value such as the grasslands studied here.","Biodiversity change ; Habitat change ; Mediterranean grasslands ; Variegated landscape ; Vascular plants","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3377-4",2015,"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2015 NOV","OECOLOGIA",179,"3","823","834","10.1007/s00442-015-3377-4","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000363559800019","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Bagaria MoratÃ³, Guillem et al.

Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversityâ€dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c. 2â€“21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversityâ€dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.","biodiversity conservation ; biodiversityâ€“ecosystem functioning relationships ; carbon storage and sequestration ; ecological production function ; economic valuation ; extinction debt ; global ecoregions ; habitat destruction ; natural capital ; social cost of carbon ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology","https://hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02962330",2015,"HAL CCSD ; Wiley","2015 FEB","ECOLOGY LETTERS",18,"2","119","134","10.1111/ele.12393","1461-023X and 1461-0248","WOS:000348719900001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Isbell, Forest et al.

"ref_009","JOUR","eng","Naaf, Tobias and Kolk, Jens","Colonization credit of post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany remains 130â€“230 years after reforestation","In many temperate regions worldwide, a large portion of deciduous forest grows on former agricultural land, while a smaller portion is 'ancient' forest on sites with no historical record of agricultural land use. The differences in species diversity between ancient and post-agricultural forests have been well documented. However, in regions where forest fragmentation occurred only a few centuries ago, it remains unclear whether these differences are due to an extinction debt in ancient forests (i.e., a delay in local species extinction), a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests (i.e., species are yet to colonize a patch), or both. Additionally, our knowledge on how soil conditions and landscape configuration interact with species' traits to determine the colonization credit is limited. Here, we surveyed ancient and post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany to quantify the magnitude of the colonization credit and identify its determinants. The colonization credit in an average forest patch amounted to 4.7 forest specialist species and ranged up to 9 species in highly isolated patches. In contrast, we found more species than predicted in patches better connected to ancient forests. The colonization credit was not smaller in older patches than it was in younger ones. Species with a low dispersal potential and a low seed output contributed most to the colonization credit. Our study demonstrates that in a landscape where the extinction debt has already been paid and only a small fraction of ancient forest is left, the recovery of forest specialist diversity in post-agricultural forests may take several centuries.

However, to what degree these shifts lag behind current climate change, and to what extent delayed extinctions and colonizations contribute to these shifts, are under debate. Here, we calculate extinction debt and colonization credit of 135 species from the European Alps by comparing species distribution models with 1576 re-surveyed plots. We find extinction debt in 60% and colonization credit in 38% of the species, and at least one of the two in 93%. This suggests that the realized niche of very few of the 135 species fully tracks climate change. As expected, extinction debts occur below and colonization credits occur above the optimum elevation of species. Colonization credits are more frequent in warmth-demanding species from lower elevations with lower dispersal capability, and extinction debts are more frequent in cold-adapted species from the highest elevations. Local extinctions hence appear to be already pending for those species which have the least opportunity to escape climate warming. ; ISSN:2041-1723","General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology ; General Physics and Astronomy ; General Chemistry","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6754411/",2019,"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","2019 SEP 20","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS",10,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41467-019-12343-x","2041-1723","WOS:000486995200003","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Rumpf, Sabine B. et al.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how current woody plant species distribution, composition and richness related to historical and present land uses. Location: A smallholder farming landscape in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1 ha sites in farmland, and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted versus permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognised conservation values, though apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in southwestern Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaic - similarly to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.

Based on two community patterns, regional species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial abundance distribution (SAAD), Kitzes and Harte (2015) presented a macroecological framework for predicting post-disturbance delayed extinction patterns in the entire ecological community. In this study, we further expand this basic framework to predict diverse time-lagged effects of habitat destruction on local communities. Specifically, our generalisation of KHâ€™s model could address the questions that could not be answered previously: (1) How many species are subjected to delayed extinction in a local community when habitat is destructed in other areas? (2) How do rare or endemic species contribute to extinction debt or immigration credit of the local community? (3) How will species differ between two local areas? From the demonstrations using two SAD models (single-parameter lognormal and logseries), the predicted patterns of the debt, credit, and change in the fraction of unique species can vary, but with consistencies and depending on several factors. The general framework deepens the understanding of the theoretical effects of habitat loss on community dynamic patterns in local samples.","Animals ; Biodiversity ; Models ; Biological ; Population Dynamics ; Spatial Analysis ; Biota ; Extinction","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430564/",2017,"Nature Publishing Group UK","2017 APR 20","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",7,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-017-01070-2","2045-2322","WOS:000424389800001","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Chen, Youhua et al.

Time lags of several decades, known as extinction debt and colonisation credit, often occur after land-use change events. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies addressing community assembly taking into account both extinction debt for habitat specialists of the former habitat and colonisation credit for habitat specialists of the new habitat. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, to address the drivers and mechanisms of time-lagged effects of habitat and landscape change on plant communities in semi-natural Mediterranean calcareous grasslands from a comprehensive approach, taking both changes in species richness and composition and their potential time lags into account. Extinction debt and colonisation credit are quantified after several decades of habitat change, and their drivers are investigated (Chapter 1). In order to disentangle the processes behind community change, the patterns and drivers of species extinctions and colonisations that already occurred are investigated through the two components of Î²-diversity: species replacement and richness differences (Chapter 2). Moreover, the role of plant traits in mediating extinctions of species of the former habitat (Chapter 3), and the population and individual-level mechanisms of extinction delay for one of the most frequent grassland specialists (Aphyllanthes monspeliensis; Chapter 4) are assessed after habitat change. The studies were conducted in the southern mountains of Catalonia (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), where forest encroachment occurred following grazing reduction during the second half of the 20th century. Although more than 50 years elapsed since the beginning of forest encroachment into these grasslands, both an important extinction debt for grassland specialists and colonisation credit for forest specialists are detected. Extinction debt was also confirmed for the grassland specialist A. monspeliensis, since its abundance depends on historical but not current connectivity. In addition, a rescue effect from surrounding grasslands and a slow vegetative and reproductive decay after habitat deterioration were identified as mechanisms enhancing extinction debt. Colonisation credit of forest plants, in turn, was probably maintained by dispersal limitation. Although species richness changed little after forest encroachment, high species replacement for the whole community occurred, resulting from idiosyncratic grassland specialists' extinctions and forest specialists' colonisations. However, while habitat fragmentation negatively affected some grassland specialists, no clear role of plant traits was found in mediating extinctions of this group. A generalised loss of grassland species and gain of forest species, resulting from the payment of extinction debt and colonisation credit, is expected to continue in the studied area even if no further forest encroachment occurs.","Riquesa d'espÃ¨cies ; riqueza de especies ; Species richness ; Beta-diversitat ; Beta-diversidad ; Beta-diversity ; Atributs biolÃ²gics ; Atributos biolÃ²gicos ; Life-history traits ; CiÃ¨ncies Experimentals ; 5","http://hdl.handle.net/10803/295705",2015,"[Barcelona] : Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Bagaria MoratÃ³, Guillem et al.

We compared composition of herbaceous plant species occurred between 1987-1991 and 2012-2013. In Ohyachi,eight species ofpteridophyte belonging to seven families and 40 species ofangiosperm belonging to 21 families became extinct. Manyoftheextinct species belonged to Brassicaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae. In Aoba-chuo, four species of pteridophyte (four families) and 22 species of angiosperm (13 families)became extinct. Many of the extinct species belonged to Asteraceae. In Ohyachiand Aoba-chuo,28angiosperm species (17families)and 32angiosperm species (18 families) immigrated, respectively. Many of the immigrated species in both Ohyachi and Aoba-chuo belonged to Asteraceae and Poaceae of angiosperm. Most of the immigrated species in both forests belonged to ruderal species or exotic species. Forest fragmentation occurred at 1958 in Ohyachi and at 1963 in Aoba-chuo. This study could verify that extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants occur 32-55 years after forest fragmentation in Ohyachi and 28-50 after in Aoba-chuo. This study will contribute to estimating date for accounting extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants in fragmented forests and to detecting the causes and the effects of them, which are required for the protection of herbaceous plants in urbanized areas of Sapporo.","çµ¶æ»…ã®é…ã‚Œ ; åˆ†æ–­æ— ; ç”Ÿæ¯åœ°æ–­ç‰‡åŒ– ; è‰æœ¬ç¨® ; ç§»å…¥ã®é…ã‚Œ ; Extinction debt ; Fragmented forest ; Habitat fragmentation ; Herbaceous plant ; Immigration","https://scu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=77",2014,"æœ­å¹Œå¸‚ç«‹å¤§å­¦",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"æ¾ç”° å²³å£« et al.

In this article, we propose the concept of â€˜â€˜colonization creditâ€™â€™ (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25â€“55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time. ; Peer reviewed","Colonization credit ; Habitat restoration ; Heathlands ; Life history traits ; Plant species richness ; Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/17944",2010,"WILEY","2010 SEP","RESTORATION ECOLOGY",18,"5","645","655","10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00495.x","1061-2971 and 1526-100X","WOS:000281552500004","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cristofoli, Sara et al.

Sc.)","The long-term legacy of historical land cover changes ; Die Langzeitfolgen historischer LandbedeckungsverÃ¤nderungen","Over the last years there is an increasing awareness that historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies may be important drivers for present-day species richness and biodiversity due to time-delayed extinctions or colonizations in response to historical environmental changes. Historically altered habitat patches may therefore exhibit an extinction debt or colonization credit and can be expected to lose or gain species in the future. However, extinction debts and colonization credits are difficult to detect and their actual magnitudes or payments have rarely been quantified because species richness patterns and dynamics are also shaped by recent environmental conditions and recent environmental changes. In this thesis we aimed to determine patterns of herb-layer species richness and recent species richness dynamics of forest herb layer plants and link those patterns and dynamics to historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies. The study was conducted in the Prignitz, NE-Germany, where the forest distribution remained stable for the last ca. 100 years but where a) the deciduous forest area had declined by more than 90 per cent (leaving only remnants of ""ancient forests""), b) small new forests had been established on former agricultural land (""post-agricultural forests""). Here, we analyzed the relative importance of land use history and associated historical land cover changes for herb layer species richness compared to recent environmental factors and determined magnitudes of extinction debt and colonization credit and their payment in ancient and post-agricultural forests, respectively. We showed that present-day species richness patterns were still shaped by historical land cover changes that ranged back to more than a century. Although recent environmental conditions were largely comparable we found significantly more forest specialists, species with short-distance dispersal capabilities and clonals in ancient forests than in post-agricultural forests. Those species richness differences were largely contingent to a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests that ranged up to 9 species (average 4.7), while the extinction debt in ancient forests had almost completely been paid. Environmental legacies from historical agricultural land use played a minor role for species richness differences. Instead, patch connectivity was most important. Species richness in ancient forests was still dependent on historical connectivity, indicating a last glimpse of an extinction debt, and the colonization credit was highest in isolated post-agricultural forests. In post-agricultural forests that were better connected or directly adjacent to ancient forest patches the colonization credit was way smaller and we were able to verify a gradual payment of the colonization credit from 2.7 species to 1.5 species over the last six decades. ; In den vergangenen Jahren reift immer mehr die Erkenntnis, dass historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen und deren Folgewirkungen einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die heutige Artenvielfalt und BiodiversitaÌˆt haben koÌˆnnen. In Habitaten, deren Landnutzung und FlaÌˆche sich in historischer Zeit veraÌˆndert hat kann aufgrund von verzoÌˆgerten Aussterbe- und Einwanderungsprozessen eine erhoÌˆhte oder verringerte Artenvielfalt vorliegen, die nicht den heutigen Umweltbedingungen entspricht. Es liegen Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungs- bzw. Kolonisierungskredite vor, welcher uÌˆber die Zeit mit Artverlusten oder Zugewinnen von Arten bezahlt werden. Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungskredite und deren Bezahlung sind schwierig zu ermitteln, da einerseits Informationen zu historischen LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen oft fehlen und andererseits auch heutige Umweltfaktoren einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die Artenvielfalt haben. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die heutigen Muster der Artenvielfalt von Waldbodenpflanzen in Laub- und MischwaÌˆldern und deren VeraÌˆnderungen uÌˆber die letzten 60 Jahre zu ermitteln und diese Muster im Hinblick auf historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen zu untersuchen. Das Studiengebiet umfasst groÃŸe Teile der Prignitz (Brandenburg und angrenzende Teile von Sachsen-Anhalt), ein Gebiet, dessen Waldanteil sich in den letzten 100 Jahren kaum veraÌˆndert hat, in dem sich jedoch seit dem Ende des 19ten Jahrhunderts der Anteil historisch alter WaÌˆlder (ohne historische nachgewiesene agrarliche Nutzung) um mehr als 90% reduziert hat, waÌˆhrend an anderer Stelle wenige neue WaÌˆlder auf vorigen AgrarflaÌˆchen etabliert wurden. Im Rahmen dieser Studie wurde zunaÌˆchst die Artenvielfalt und deren aktuelle VeraÌˆnderung in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern untersucht und verglichen. Um den Einfluss von historischen LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen auf die Artenvielfalt zu ermittlen, wurde die historische und heutige Vernetzung der WaldflaÌˆchen analysiert, die Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern verglichen und der Umfang und die Bezahlung der Aussterbeschulden und der Kolonisierungskredite ermittelt. Die Arbeit zeigt, dass historische LandnutzungsveraÌˆnderungen die heutige Artenvielfalt noch immer beeinflussen. Obwohl die heutigen Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten und neu etablierten WaÌˆldern vergleichbar waren, war die Gesamtartenzahl in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern signifikant hoÌˆher und in diesen WaÌˆldern wurden insbesondere mehr Waldspezialisten und sich nur uÌˆber kurze Enfernung ausbreitende Pflanzenarten gefunden. Die Unterschiede in den Artenzahlen sind vor allem auf einen Kolonisierungskredit in neu etablierten WaÌˆldern zuruÌˆckzufuÌˆhren, waÌˆhrend die Aussterbeschulden in historisch-alten WaÌˆldern weitgehend bezahlt wurden. Der Kolonisierungskredits war am hoÌˆchsten in isoliert gelegenen WaldflaÌˆchen und belief sich auf bis zu 9 Arten (im Mittel 4,7). Der Kolonisierungskredit in besser vernetzten und in direkt an historisch-alten WaÌˆldern angrenzenden FlaÌˆchen war deutlich geringer. In diesen WaÌˆldern konnte eine Verringerung des Kolonisierungskredites von im Mittel 2,7 zu 1,5 Arten uÌˆber die letzten sechs Jahrzehnte nachgewiesen werden.","Extern ; Institut fÃ¼r Biochemie und Biologie","https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/43939",2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Kolk, Jens (M.

However, the potential for species credit in landscapes that have experienced a change from decreasing to expanding forest cover has received little attention. Both delayed responses should depend on current landscape forest cover and on species life-history traits, such as longevity, as short-lived species are likely to respond faster than long-lived species. We evaluated the effects of historical and present-day local forest cover on two vertebrate groups with different longevities understorey birds and non-flying small mammals - in forest patches at three Atlantic Forest landscapes. Our work investigated how the probability of extinction debt and species credit varies (i) amongst landscapes with different proportions of forest cover and distinct trajectories of forest cover change, and (ii) between taxa with different life spans. Our results suggest that the existence of extinction debt and species credit, as well as the potential for their future payment and/or receipt, is not only related to forest cover trajectory but also to the amount of remaining forest cover at the landscape scale. Moreover, differences in bird and small mammal life spans seem to be insufficient to affect differently their probability of showing time-delayed responses to landscape change. Synthesis and applications. Our work highlights the need for considering not only the trajectory of deforestation/regeneration but also the amount of forest cover at landscape scale when investigating time-delayed responses to landscape change. As many landscapes are experiencing a change from decreasing to expanding forest cover, understanding the association of extinction and immigration processes, as well as their interactions with the landscape dynamic, is a key factor to plan conservation and restoration actions in human-altered landscapes.","Ecology","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02214.x",2012,"Wiley","2012 DEC","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY",49,"6","1325","1333","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02214.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000311855000014","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lira, Paula K. et al.

Bird community characteristics and population trends in secondary forests are infrequently studied, but secondary forest may serve as a â€œsafety netâ€ for tropical biodiversity. Less understood is the occurrence of time-delayed, community-level dynamics such as an extinction debt of specialist species or a species credit resulting from the recolonization of forest patches by extirpated species. We sought to elucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities in secondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year period during the late breeding season and mid-winter. We classified birds caught in mist nets or recorded in point counts by residency status, and further grouped them based on preferred habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, conservation priority, foraging guild, and foraging strata. Using hierarchical, mixed-effects models we tested for trends among species that share traits. We found that permanent-resident species increased over time relative to migrants. In both seasons, primary forest species generally increased while species typical of secondary forest, scrub, or edge declined. Species relatively sensitive to habitat disturbance increased significantly over time, whereas birds less sensitive to disturbance decreased. Similarly, generalists with higher habitat breadth scores declined. Because, we found very few changes in vegetation characteristics in secondary forest patches, shifts in the avian community toward primary forest species represent a species credit and are likely related to vegetation changes in the broader landscape. We suggest that natural regeneration and maturation of secondary forests should be recognized as a positive conservation development of potential benefit even to species typical of primary forest.","Avian abundance ; Habitat change ; Land use ; Neotropical migratory birds ; Tropical countryside ; Medicine ; R","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494173/",2017,"PeerJ Inc.","2017 JUN 30","PEERJ",5,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.3539","2167-8359","WOS:000405264100008","341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Latta, Steven C. et al.

Location: A smallholder farming landscape in south-western Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1-ha sites in farmland and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted vs. permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognized conservation values, although apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in south-western Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaicâ€”similar to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.","agricultural mosaic ; biodiversity conservation ; extinction debt ; immigration credit ; novel ecosystems ; nurse tree effect ; /dk/atira/pure/core/keywords/nachhaltigkeitswissenschaft ; Sustainability Science","http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/land-use-legacy-effects-on-woody-vegetation-in-agricultural-landscapes-of-southwestern-ethiopia(33e0aa60-b9e4-45e6-a9ec-9b8cb6ce5291).html",2018,"WILEY","2018 AUG","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS",24,"8","1136","1148","10.1111/ddi.12754","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000438200700009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Shumi, Girma et al.

Given their spatial configuration, alpine areas have been traditionally seen as islands surrounded by an â€œoceanâ€ of unsuitable lands. A quantitative assessment of the effects of Holocene climate fluctuations on islands area and interâ€island connectivity is crucial to finely reconstruct past biodiversity dynamics and forecast species responses to future changes. Location Italy. Taxa Carabidae (Ground beetles), Chrysomelidae (Leaf beetles), Elateridae (Click beetles), Orthoptera (Grasshoppers and Crickets) and Papilionoidea (Butterflies and Skippers). Methods A total of 1,077 species for 128,093 records were analysed and a classification based on their functional traits allowed identifying groups of good and poor dispersers within each taxon. A dynamic discrete model of ecosystem evolution provided the spatioâ€temporal context to test two competing (transient equilibria vs. nonequilibrium) dynamics based on different colonization capabilities. In the transient equilibria dynamic the species are able to respond to island evolution through successful dispersal and colonization events, whereas in the nonequilibrium dynamic ineffective immigration constrains the current species richness to that generated by the strongest island contraction. Results With the exception of Elateridae, good dispersers (Chrysomelidae and Papilionoidea) responded to environmental changes by establishing a series of transient equilibria. In contrast, the nonequilibrium dynamic better described patterns of species richness in poor dispersers (Carabidae and Orthoptera). Main conclusions Our approach could be used as the basis for the development of spatially and temporally explicit models of island evolution and could be a valuable tool for quantifying the sensitivity of single taxa to climateâ€driven habitat changes. It also represents a further step towards the forecasting of future responses to climate change and the accompanying development of conservation strategies that more effectively respond to the detrimental impacts of climate change on biodiversity.","Alpine ecosystems ; Alpine species ; extinction debt ; holocene ; immigration credit ; island biogeography ; island evolution ; nonequilibrium dynamics ; transient equilibria ; Settore BIO/05","http://hdl.handle.net/2108/216483",2019,"WILEY","2019 OCT","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY",46,"10","2248","2259","10.6084/m9.figshare.8204816.v1","0305-0270 and 1365-2699","DRCI:DATA2019173016907266","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Marta, Silvio et al.

B. and Siqueira, Tadeu","Interactive persistent effects of past land-cover and its trajectory on tropical freshwater biodiversity","Evidence indicating that ecological communities show delayed responses to environmental change has raised the need to better understand the effects of landscape history on biodiversity. We investigated how freshwater biodiversity is related to both recent and past land use change in tropical river catchments. More specifically, we analysed the relationship between biodiversity and change in forest cover that occurred across five decades, including landscape trajectories of forest gain and loss. The abundance of stream insects showed a more delayed response to landscape change than rarefied richness, whereas the Tsallis diversity index was not related to past forest cover. However, both alpha diversity and local abundance were related to mean forest cover across the five decades when conditioned by the trajectory of change. We found a negative relationship between the historical mean of forest cover and community descriptors in streams embedded in landscapes on a trajectory of forest loss, but a positive relationship in landscapes on a trajectory of forest gain. We provide the first evidence of delayed responses of tropical freshwater insect communities to landscape history and suggest that the magnitude of change in forest cover, mediated by its trajectory, is a major driver of delayed responses. We show that a trajectory of forest loss might result in both immediate loss of species and a set of species doomed for future extinction. Synthesis and applications. Delayed responses of multispecies communities to past landscape changes depend on their extent, frequency and intensity. Our findings indicate that, beyond the relative amount of forest cover within river catchments, the magnitude of change in forest cover mediated by its historical trajectory can be a major driver of delayed responses in stream communities. We suggest that, if biodiversity conservation is the main aim, stream restoration should be prioritized in catchments with higher forest cover, as even under a forest gain trajectory, stream communities continue responding to past landscape changes depending on how widespread and intensive changes were.","aquatic biodiversity ; deforestation ; extinction debt ; forest recovery ; freshwater ecosystems ; immigration credit ; landscape history ; tropical streams","http://hdl.handle.net/11449/199186",2020,"WILEY","2020 NOV","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY",57,"11","2149","2158","10.1111/1365-2664.13717","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000554431200001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Santos, Edineusa P. et al.

These habitats nowadays benefit from large-scale restoration projects, for which the success should be evaluated.Recently, the concept of colonisation credit (the number of species yet to colonise a patch) was proposed as a spatially explicit framework to assess recovery in species richness following restoration. In this study, we estimated the colonisation credit of wet heathland butterfly communities in Southern Belgium. The method was applied separately to generalist and specialist species for two reference dates (new patches < 25 years old and new patches 25-55 years old).Only a marginally significant colonisation credit was detected for generalist species. In contrast, we found a significant colonisation credit for specialists, although this was due to a very limited number of strict specialist species. Butterfly community composition differed only marginally between patch age classes.As a general trend, butterfly communities exhibit a rapid response (< 25 years) to landscape structure modification. However, conservation and restoration actions should urgently target strict specialists, exhibiting colonisation limitation in new habitat patches. A lack of colonisation credit for plant communities in the same landscape suggests that restoration of wet heathlands may be successful in the short term for various taxonomic groups.","Life sciences :: Environmental sciences & ecology ; Sciences du vivant :: Sciences de l'environnement & Ã©cologie","https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/67404",2010,"WILEY","2010 MAY","INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY",3,"2","83","91","10.1111/j.1752-4598.2009.00075.x","1752-458X and 1752-4598","WOS:000276404300003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cristofoli, Sara et al.

Plant species may exhibit a slow response to fragmentation, resulting in the development of an extinction debt in fragmented plant communities. The detection of extinction debt is of primary importance in habitat conservation strategies. We applied two different approaches proposed in the literature to identify extinction debt in South-East Belgium calcareous grasslands. The first method compared species richness between stable and fragmented habitat patches. The second explored correlations between current species richness and current and past landscape configurations using multiple regression analyses. We subsequently examined results generated by both methods. In addition, we proposed techniques to identify species that are more likely to support extinction debt and associated functional traits. We estimated a respective extinction debt of approximately 28% and 35% of the total and specialist species richness. Similar results were obtained from both methods. We identified 15 threatened specialist species under the current landscape configuration. It is likely the landscape configuration no longer supports the species habitat requirements. We demonstrated that non-clonal species are most threatened, as well as taxa that cannot persist in degraded habitats and form only sparsely distributed populations. We discussed our results in light of other studies in similar habitats, and the overall implications for habitat conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"ref_030","CONF","en","Dupouey, Jean-Luc","Forest ecological history for the future","International audience ; Historical, archaeological and paleoecological data provide a better understanding of the current distribution of species, which cannot be inferred directly from the sole knowledge of their fundamental ecological niche, dispersal ability and interactions with other species. The long time is an additional component, which is the object of historical ecology, the branch of ecology that is interested in legacies of the past in the current functioning of ecosystems. We will present some examples of the significance of these long-term effects.The first concerns the impact of past land-use changes on vegetation. Europe has known for the last two centuries a significant increase in forest area. We show the multiple impacts on the composition of plant communities of this forest expansion, in the Mediterranean area among others. This has led to the development of the important concept of ancient and recent forests, which is now classically included in assessments of the degree of naturalness of forests. We have tried to characterize the duration of these impacts: following the recolonization of a former agricultural soil, how long time does it take to erase the extinction debt of the species previously present but destined to disappear, and the colonization credit of the species that still have to arrive? The research that we have conducted on several Roman sites shows that these impacts have a multi-millennial span. We analyze the mechanisms of this strikingly long memory of ecosystems.In a second example, we will search for anthropogenic traces in the current spatial range of Fagus sylvatica in France. The resampling of dendrometric inventories from the XVIIIth century, the distribution of toponyms of beech at the national scale and soil charcoal analyses show how this tree species has been disadvantaged by forest management, perhaps early in the Neolithic period. Knowledge of such large-scale manipulations is needed to properly characterize the beech climatic niche, in order to be able to project its future distribution range into different climate change scenarios.The reaction times of plant communities to natural or anthropogenic disturbances can be very long, as shown by the examples presented. This has many consequences: climacic equilibria are rarely or never reached, the impacts of human actions should be appreciated over much longer time horizons than they are today, the understanding of our biotic environment cannot be done without an historical perspective. Time must be considered as a relevant attribute of the species niche.","[SDV.EE.ECO]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Ecology ; environment/Ecosystems ; [SDV.SA.SF]Life Sciences [q-bio]/Agricultural sciences/Silviculture ; forestry ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology ; [SDE.MCG]Environmental Sciences/Global Changes ; [SHS.ENVIR]Humanities and Social Sciences/Environmental studies","https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-03084784",2019,"HAL CCSD",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_base_part1.ris",1,"Dupouey, Jean-Luc (2019) Forest Ecological History for the Future. <i>Conf</i>.

Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas where such conservation activities should be implemented. ; Fil: Semper Pascual, AsunciÃ³n. UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin; Alemania ; Fil: Macchi, Leandro.

The model encapsulates previous approaches based on diversity-dependent (DD) extinction rates while allowing for a more flexible treatment of temporal dynamics. Three important results emerge. First, species loss rate slows down with the age of the isolate, a strong and general pattern largely unnoticed so far. Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms.

Historical data on plant species distribution patterns can provide valuable information in this context. Therefore, the aims of this research are to study how the loss of heathland area has changed the presence of heathland and forest plant species in north-western Belgium using historical plant distribution data, and to test whether the heathland flora shows an extinction debt. Furthermore, plant traits determining extinction sensitivity are investigated.Our results revealed that, despite the dramatic reduction of heathland area (more than 99% of heathland was destroyed over a 230-year period), the loss of heathland species is relatively limited (11%) and is comparable with that of forest species (11%). Heathland species that have a long-term persistent seed bank or can propagate vegetatively are least sensitive to extinction. For forest species, on the other hand, growth form is the key determinant for extinction sensitivity. Long-lived woody species have a greater chance of persisting.The relatively low extinction numbers probably represent an extinction debt and the full effects of habitat loss may not have been fully manifested yet. Consequently, future extinctions are expected to occur unless environmental conditions are improved. Therefore, heathland restoration and prevention of further heathland area losses is required.

It is important, therefore, to consider habitat destruction when assessing population viability. Another factor often ignored in population viability analysis, is the Allee effect that adds to the risk of populations already on the verge of extinction. Understanding the Allee effect on species dynamics and response to habitat destruction has intrinsic value in conservation prioritization. Here, the Allee effect was considered in a multi-species hierarchical competition model. Results showed that species persistence declines dramatically due to the Allee effect, and certain species become more susceptible to habitat destruction than others. Two extinction orders emerged under habitat destruction: either the best competitor becomes extinct first or the best colonizer first. The extinction debt and order, as well as the time lag between habitat destruction and species extinction, were found to be determined by species abundance and the intensity of the Allee effect.

Habitat loss leading to smaller patch sizes and decreasing connectivity is a major threat to global biodiversity. While some species vanish immediately after a change in habitat conditions, others show delayed extinction, that is, an extinction debt. In case of an extinction debt, the current species richness is higher than expected under present habitat conditions. 2. We investigated wetlands of the canton of ZÃ¼rich in the lowlands of Eastern Switzerland where a wetland loss of 90% over the last 150 years occurred. We related current species richness to current and past patch area and connectivity (in 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000). We compared current with predicted species richness in wetlands with a substantial loss in patch area based on the speciesâ€area relationship of wetlands without substantial loss in patch area and studied relationships between the richness of different species groups and current and historical area and connectivity of wetland patches. 3. We found evidence of a possible extinction debt for longâ€lived wetland specialist vascular plants: in wetlands, which substantially lost patch area, current species richness of longâ€lived specialist vascular plants was higher than would have been expected based on current patch area. Additionally and besides current wetland area, historical area also explained current species richness of these species in a substantial and significant way. No evidence for an extinction debt in bryophytes was found. 4. The possible unpaid extinction debt in the wetlands of the canton of ZÃ¼rich is an appeal to nature conservation, which has the possibility to prevent likely future extinctions of species through specific conservation measures. In particular, a further reduction in wetlands must be prevented and restoration measures must be taken to increase the number of wetlands.","bryophytes ; extinction debt ; habitat area ; habitat fragmentation ; nature conservation ; vascular plants ; Ecology ; QH540-549.5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396007",2020,"Wiley","2020 FEB","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION",10,"3","1264","1277","10.1002/ece3.5980","2045-7758","WOS:000508506800001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Jamin, Anine et al.

We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land-use history from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, to test for an extinction debt in relation to species-specific extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presenceâ€“absence of 36 plant species were first parameterized using data from Lincolnshire, where forest cover has been relatively low (âˆ¼5â€“8%) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory, for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant, where forest cover was reduced from âˆ¼25% to <10% between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5%). As a consequence, the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus, more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover.","Environmental Science ; Ecology","https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.C.3299021.V1",2016,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2006 MAR","ECOLOGY",87,"3","542","548","10.1890/05-1182","0012-9658","WOS:000236289600002","1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mark Vellend et al.

But a consensus about the prevalence of extinctions debts is hindered by a multiplicity of methods and a lack of comparisons among habitats. We applied three contrasting speciesâ€“area relationship methods to test for plant community extinction debts in three habitats which had different degradation histories over the last century: calcareous grassland, heathland and woodland. These methods differ in their data requirements, with the first two using information on past and current habitat area alongside current species richness, whilst the last method also requires data on past species richness. The most dataâ€intensive, and hence arguably most reliable method, identified extinction debts across all habitats for specialist species, whilst the other methods did not. All methods detected an extinction debt in calcareous grassland, which had undergone the most severe degradation. We conclude that some methods failed to detect an extinction debt, particularly in habitats that have undergone moderate degradation.

Biodiversity loss in turn affects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forward-looking policies for the long-term sustainability of humanâ€“nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win effects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of efficient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics. ; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Extinction debt; Social-ecological system; Sustainability; Land tax;","Land tax ; Sustainability ; Social-ecological system ; Ecosystem services ; Extinction debt ; Biodiversity ; [SDE.BE]Environmental Sciences/Biodiversity and Ecology","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800918305585",2018,"HAL CCSD ; Elsevier","2018 DEC","ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS",154,NA,"272","281","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.08.003","0921-8009 and 1873-6106","WOS:000446282700024","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lafuite, Anne-Sophie et al.

Here, we test for such a delay in impact by relating numbers of threatened species appearing on national red lists to historical and contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. Across 22 European countries, the proportions of vascular plants, bryophytes, mammals, reptiles, dragonflies, and grasshoppers facing medium-to-high extinction risks are more closely matched to indicators of socioeconomic pressures (i.e., human population density, per capita gross domestic product, and a measure of land use intensity) from the early or mid-, rather than the late, 20th century. We conclude that, irrespective of recent conservation actions, large-scale risks to biodiversity lag considerably behind contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. The negative impact of human activities on current biodiversity will not become fully realized until several decades into the future. Mitigating extinction risks might be an even greater challenge if temporal delays mean many threatened species might already be destined toward extinction.","extinction debt ; socioeconomic history ; time lag ; Animals ; Humans ; Multivariate Analysis ; Species Specificity ; Models ; Biological ; Socioeconomic Factors ; Europe ; Extinction ; Endangered Species ; 069902 Global Change Biology ; 160403 Social and Cultural Geography ; 060311 Speciation and Extinction ; 05 Environmental Sciences","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3645564",2013,"National Academy of Sciences","2013 APR 30","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",110,"18","7342","7347","10.1073/pnas.1216303110","0027-8424","WOS:000318682300054","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",2,"Dullinger, Stefan et al.

Extreme storms can rapidly overcome this lag, especially for coastal species, but how will stormâ€driven expansion shape intraspecific genetic variation? Do storms provide recruits only from the nearest sources, or from more distant sources? Answers to these questions have ecological and evolutionary implications, but empirical evidence is absent from the literature. In 2017, Hurricane Irma provided an opportunity to address this knowledge gap at the northern range limit of the neotropical black mangrove (Avicennia germinans ) on the Atlantic coast of Florida, USA. We observed massive postâ€hurricane increases in beachâ€stranded A. germinans propagules at, and past, this speciesâ€™ presentâ€day range margin when compared to a previouslyâ€surveyed, nonâ€hurricane year. Yet, propagule dispersal does not guarantee subsequent establishment and reproductive success (i.e., effective dispersal). We also evaluated prior effective dispersal along this coastline with isolated A. germinans trees identified beyond the most northern established population. We used 12 nuclear microsatellite loci to genotype 896 hurricaneâ€driven drift propagules from nine sites and 10 isolated trees from four sites, determined their sources of origin, and estimated dispersal distances. Almost all drift propagules and all isolated trees came from the nearest sources. This research suggests that hurricanes are a prerequisite for poleward range expansion of a coastal tree species and that storms can shape the expanding gene pool by providing almost exclusively rangeâ€margin genotypes. These insights and empirical estimates of hurricaneâ€driven dispersal distances should improve our ability to forecast distributional shifts of coastal species.",NA,"https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/625956/3/OriginalArticle_Kennedy-etal_accepted.pdf",2020,"Wiley","2020 JUL","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY",29,"14","2583","2597","10.1111/mec.15513","0962-1083 and 1365-294X","WOS:000545634100001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kennedy, John Paul et al.

Although changes to the occurrence and abundance of species likely have cascading effects (e.g. on species of other trophic levels, genes, community structure and ecosystem processes), current concepts addressing lagged biodiversity responses are limited to single drivers affecting a few biodiversity components (e.g. extinction debt in terms of species numbers or population size). Little attention has been paid to the interacting and cumulative nature of time-lag phenomena. Here, we synthesize current knowledge, mechanisms and implications of delayed biodiversity responses and propose a cumulative biodiversity lags-framework' which aims to integrate lagged responses of various components of biological organization.LocationGlobal.ResultsEffects of change in environmental forcing are transmitted along a series of linked cause-effect relationships which act on different biodiversity components (e.g. individuals, populations, species, communities). We show that lagged responses to environmental forcing are caused by different mechanisms (e.g. metapopulation dynamics, dispersal limitation, successional dynamics), which operate sequentially on these intermediary links. Lags manifest themselves on the respective biodiversity component which changes over time; the full relaxation time of a focal system will therefore depend on the aggregate length of different lags. We elucidate key mechanisms and circumstances which are likely to cause cumulative lagged responses, and propose research avenues to improve understanding of cumulative biodiversity lags.Main conclusionsThe failure to give adequate consideration to widespread cumulative time-lags often masks the full extent of biodiversity changes that have already been triggered. Effects that are particularly relevant for human livelihoods (e.g. changes in the provision of ecosystem services) may emerge with the most pronounced delay.

More knowledge is, however, needed on how to facilitate the immigration of such taxa in restored forest patches. Here, we present the first chronosequence study to quantify the dynamics of immigration credits of forest specialist plants in post-arable forest patches. We studied the distribution of herbaceous forest specialist plant species in 54 post-arable broadleaved forest patches along gradients of age (20-140 years since forest establishment), distance from ancient forest (0-2,600 m) and patch area (0.5-9.6 ha). With linear mixed models, we estimated the effects of these factors on species richness, patch means of four dispersal-related plant traits and with generalized linear models on the occurrence of 20 individual species. Post-arable forest patch age and spatial isolation from ancient forest, but not patch size, were important predictors for species richness of forest specialists, suggesting that also small patches are valuable for habitat connectivity. Compared to species richness in ancient forest stands, the immigration credit was reduced by more than 90% after 80 years in post-arable forest patches contiguous to ancient forest compared to 40% after 80 years and 60% after 140 years in isolated patches (at least 100 m to next forest). Tall-growing species with adaptations to long-distance dispersal were faster colonizers, whereas species with heavy diaspores and clonal growth were slower to colonize. Synthesis and applications. We show that post-arable oak plantations have a high potential for restoration of forest herb vegetation. Dispersal-related plant traits play a key role in explaining interspecific differences among forest specialists.

Here, land-use history is considered a key driver of recent herb-layer community changes, where an extinction debt in ancient forest remnants and/or a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests are being paid over time. On a regional scale, these payments should in theory lead toward a convergence in species richness between ancient and post-agricultural forests over time. In this study, we tested this assumption with a resurvey of 117 semi-permanent plots in the well-studied deciduous forests of the Prignitz region (Brandenburg, NE Germany), where we knew that the plant communities of post-agricultural stands exhibit a colonization credit while the extinction debt in ancient stands has largely been paid. We compared changes in the species richness of all herb layer species, forest specialists and ancient forest indicator species between ancient and post-agricultural stands with linear mixed effect models and determined the influence of patch connectivity on the magnitude of species richness changes. Species richness increased overall, but the richness of forest specialists increased significantly more in post-agricultural stands and was positively influenced by higher patch connectivity, indicating a convergence in species richness between the ancient and postagricultural stands. Furthermore, the richness of ancient forest indicator species only increased significantly in post-agricultural stands.

However, both scale and time delay issues can be tackled when, at each study site, we consider dynamics in both observed and dark diversity. Dark diversity includes those species in the region that can potentially establish and thrive in the local sites' conditions but are currently locally absent. Effectively, dark diversity connects biodiversity at the study site to the regional scales and defines the site-specific species pool (observed and dark diversity together). With dark diversity, it is possible to decompose species gains and losses into two space-related components: one associated with local dynamics (species moving from observed to dark diversity and vice versa) and another related to gains and losses of site-specific species pool (species moving to and from the pool after regional immigration, regional extinction or change in local ecological conditions). Extinction debt and immigration credit are useful to understand dynamics in observed diversity, but delays might happen in species pool changes as well. In this opinion piece we suggest that considering both observed and dark diversity and their temporal dynamics provides a deeper understanding of biodiversity changes. Considering both observed and dark diversity creates opportunities to improve conservation by allowing to identify species that are likely to go regionally extinct as well as foreseeing which of the species that newly arrive to the region are more likely to colonize local sites. Finally, by considering temporal lags and species gains and losses in observed and dark diversity, we combine phenomena at both spatial and temporal scales, providing a novel tool to examine biodiversity change in the Anthropocene.",NA,NA,2020,"WILEY","2020 JUN","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY",26,"6","3193","3201","10.1111/gcb.15093","1354-1013 and 1365-2486","WOS:000525977700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Trindade, Diego P.

This is a fact that most recent literature on extinction debts pays little attention to. We argue that extinction debts can arise because (i) individuals survive in resistant life-cycle stages long after habitat quality change, (ii) stochastic extinctions of populations that have become small are not immediate, and (iii) metapopulations survive long after that connectivity has decreased if colonization-extinction dynamics is slow.

In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management. Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit, whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland fragmentation, and with particular species' life history traits. Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization.

Objectives We aimed to disentangle the role of forest connectivity and climatic aridity in the assembly of woody plant communities present in expanding Mediterranean forests by studying species with different types of dispersal. Methods We used a space-for-time approach in recent (post 1980), middle-aged (1956-1980) and long-established forests (pre-1956) along an aridity and forest connectivity gradient in NE Spain. We recorded woody canopy and understory species and classified them as either vertebrate-, non-vertebrate- or human-dispersed species (i.e., crops). Results Species turnover between forests of different ages was limited to particular species and did not give rise to colonization credits determined by plant dispersal type. Connectivity and aridity drove understory richness in a similar way in forests of different ages. Within this general pattern, non-vertebrate-dispersed species were especially promoted by benign conditions. Sites with high forest connectivity had either the richest or the most impoverished understories given, respectively, low or high aridity. Thus, the rescue effect was modulated by aridity, which acted as a limiting factor. Conclusions Mediterranean forest richness and composition are strongly dependent on climatic constraints and the 'rescue effects' (connectivity) originating in surrounding forest areas.

The results point to the conclusion that it generally pays to concentrate the efforts of improving forest quality at certain areas rather than to spread the same total effort evenly and therefore thinly throughout the entire forest landscape. The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species.

The model is general and predicts how transition behaviors of extinction may accumulate according to different combination of random drift, immigration rate, emigration rate, and the degree of habitat destruction. We show that emigration, the areal size of the destroyed habitat, and initial species abundance distribution can impact the total biodiversity loss in an intact local area. Among these, the species abundance distribution plays the most deterministic role, as it directly determines the initial species richness in the local target area. In contrast, immigration was found to slow down total biodiversity loss and can drive the emergence of species credits (i.e., a gain of species) over time. However, emigration process would increase the extinction risk of species and accelerate biodiversity loss. Finally but notably, we found that a shift in the emigration rate after a habitat destruction event may be a new mechanism to generate species credits.

Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.",NA,NA,2016,"WILEY","2016 JAN","OIKOS",125,"1","107","116","10.1111/oik.02534","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000369953100013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Basnou, Corina et al.

To evaluate the conservation effectiveness of tree group retention (in this case, buffer strips along streams), we studied the bryophyte community once prior to, and twice after logging, comparing one buffer and one clear-cut plot (0.1 ha) in each of 13 riparian sites. We asked whether time-lagged responses or recovery processes had dominated the period between two re-inventories, 2.5 and 10.5 years after logging, focusing both on the whole community and on species of conservation concern. Although there were examples of recovering species in both clear-cuts and buffer strips, the similarity in species composition to predisturbance conditions had decreased in the second re-inventory. Even if the buffer strips displayed more time-lagged colonizations and local extinctions over the later period compared to the clear-cuts, the overall species composition in the buffer strips was still significantly more similar to the prelogging conditions than the clear-cuts. The red-listed species had mostly declined during the first period, and the number of red-list species per plot (mostly species growing on dead wood) was rather stable at <20% of predisturbance levels in clear-cuts and <60% in buffer strips in the last re-inventory. Synthesis and applications. We show that most extinctions of red-list species occurred soon after disturbance and that the conclusions drawn from a study carried out 2.5 years after the disturbance did not change profoundly 8 years later. Although the species composition in the buffer strips continued to change over time, sensitive species survived much better in buffer strips than in clear-cuts, which supports the practice of retaining buffer strips for terrestrial species too. This knowledge should encourage managers to find ways of increasing the efficacy of this practice. One obvious measure could be to retain wider strips or implement other management practices that make the buffer strips less sensitive to wind, which will lead to higher tree retention to support a prelogging species composition.",NA,NA,2012,"WILEY","2012 DEC","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY",49,"6","1316","1324","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02218.x","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000311855000013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Hylander, Kristoffer et al.

To do so, public regulators acknowledge conservation banks and endangered species credit production as the most robust policy instruments, as they allow for ecological restoration ahead of impacts. The aim of this paper is to show how endangered species credits, as 'environmental intangibles,' are designed and produced so as to meet two diverging objectives, that is, ensuring permanent conservation and attracting private investors. Permanent conservation is ensured through financial insurances, which tie environmental intangibles to a very tangible asset, land. Therefore, environmental credit-making is not only a matter of scientific measurement; as commodities crafted out of government regulation, environmental intangibles also need to be legally stabilized, including through the use of property and financial tools. This securement entails important production costs that limit investors' profits.

Additional examples illustrate the incentives for creating habitats that support abundant, stable populations and the incentives for reducing the severity and duration of impacts to habitats.

Especially for habitat specialists such as several forest plants they can provide important refuge habitats. Objectives This study aims to examine whether there is an extinction debt for forest plants in hedgerows. Methods In a study area in Northern Germany that had lost 47% of the hedgerow network over the past 120 years, hedgerows were mapped for the presence of forest vascular plants. In a multi-model approach, we compared the explanatory power of present and historical landscape variables and habitat quality on diversity patterns. Results The change in landscape configuration had no effect on the species richness of forest plants in hedgerows, i.e. there was no sign of an extinction debt. The best explanatory variable was the hedgerow width with more species found in wider hedgerows. This demonstrates the importance of including local habitat variables in the study of extinction debt. For ancient woodland indicator species models including both the landscape configuration and habitat variables were superior to simple models. The best models included the historical distance to the nearest forest, suggesting an extinction debt. Counterintuitively, a high density of hedgerows had a negative influence on species richness, most likely because hedgerows are narrower in areas with higher densities due to land-saving measures by farmers.

In the Laurentian Great Lakes, wetlands have been significantly lost as a result of agricultural land-use practice, yet high species richness and several at-risk fishes persist. These patterns lead to the hypothesis that Great Lakes wetland fishes are in extinction debt, meaning there is a time lag between habitat loss and local extinction. To test this hypothesis, we sampled current species richness of wetland-specialist fishes in protected and unprotected wetlands in the Lake Erie basin. We predicted species richness in unprotected wetlands using parameter estimates (slope and intercept) from protected wetlands. Extinction debt was measured as a positive difference between predicted and observed species richness. We determined how much area would be required to support current species richness and compared this to minimum-area requirements for eight at-risk fishes. Species richness was significantly higher than predicted in unprotected wetlands, indicating that fishes in them are in extinction debt. This result indicates that there is time available to restore disturbed wetlands and prevent local extinction. We identified 17 wetlands of high priority for restoration (> 10 species bound for extinction) and determined that the restoration of 178 km(2) of wetland habitat would reduce the risk of future biodiversity loss.

Life history traits such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt, but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs for vascular plants and three insect taxa.LocationSouth-eastern Sweden.MethodWe sampled current species richness of habitat specialist and generalist butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and vascular plants in 45 dry to mesic semi-natural grassland fragments of various size and degree of connectivity, and situated in landscapes with contrasting land use conversion history. Habitat loss was estimated in each landscape by comparing modern maps to ~45year old digitized aerial photographs. An extinction debt can be assumed if historical habitat size and connectivity better explain current species distribution than current habitat variables do.ResultsBees responded rapidly to habitat loss possibly as a result of their primary nesting resource being destroyed.

Duncan and Smart, Simon M.","How well is current plant trait composition predicted by modern and historical forest spatial configuration?","There is increasing evidence to suggest that a delayed response of many forest species to habitat loss and fragmentation leads to the development of extinction debts and immigration credits in affected forest habitat. These time lags result in plant communities which are not well predicted by present day landscape structure, reducing the accuracy of biodiversity assessments and predictions for future change. Here, species richness data and mean values for five life history characteristics within deciduous broadleaved forest habitat across Great Britain were used to quantify the degree to which aspects of present day forest plant composition are best explained by modern or historical forest patch area. Ancient forest specialist richness, mean rarity and mean seed terminal velocity were not well predicted by modern patch area, implying the existence of a degree of lag in British forest patches. Mean seedbank persistence values were more closely related to modern patch area than historical, particularly in larger patches. The variation in response for different mean trait values suggests that species respond to landscape change at different rates depending upon their combinations of different trait states. Current forest understorey communities are therefore likely to consist of a mixture of declining species whose extinction debt is still to be paid, and faster colonising immigrant species. These results indicate that without management action, rare and threatened species of plant are likely to be lost in the future as a result of changes in forest spatial configuration that have already taken place. The lag seen here for rare specialist plants suggests however that there may still be scope to protect such species before they are lost from forest patches.",NA,NA,2016,"WILEY","2016 JAN","ECOGRAPHY",39,"1","67","76","10.1111/ecog.01607","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000368792500008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kimberley, Adam et al.

However, slow population decline also opens an opportunity to repay the debt by restoring habitat. The timing necessary for such habitat restoration to rescue a population from extinction has not been well studied. Here, we determine habitat restoration deadlines for a spatially implicit Levins/Tilman population model modified by an Allee effect. We find that restoration deadlines depend nonlinearly on initial, temporary, and final habitat destruction values. Conditions that hinder detection of an extinction debt also provide forgiving restoration timeframes.

In this Perspective, the authors explore the effects of time lags on biodiversity indicators using both theory and empirical data.Global conservation targets to reverse biodiversity declines and halt species extinctions are not being met despite decades of conservation action. However, a lack of measurable change in biodiversity indicators towards these targets is not necessarily a sign that conservation has failed; instead, temporal lags in species' responses to conservation action could be masking our ability to observe progress towards conservation success. Here we present our perspective on the influence of ecological time lags on the assessment of conservation success and review the principles of time lags and their ecological drivers. We illustrate how a number of conceptual species may respond to change in a theoretical landscape and evaluate how these responses might influence our interpretation of conservation success. We then investigate a time lag in a real biodiversity indicator using empirical data and explore alternative approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive time lags. Our proposal for setting and evaluating conservation targets is to use milestones, or interim targets linked to specific ecological mechanisms at key points in time, to assess whether conservation actions are likely to be working.

Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies limits our understanding of how patch dynamics affect biodiversity, especially when there is a time lag in species extinctions (extinction debt). We assessed how temporal changes in patch size, shape complexity and isolation affect populations of the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hypothesizing that we would find an extinction debt in this relatively long-lived species. We assessed patch occupancy, subpopulation size and immature-to-female ratio in 39 forest patches from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, in both 2001 and 2013. To identify time-lag responses to habitat disturbance, we related demographic attributes in 2013 to patch metrics in 2001 and 2013 and tested whether primate subpopulations were better predicted by current or historical patch characteristics. We also assessed how changes in patch metrics affected each demographic attribute between 2001 and 2013. Patch size and shape complexity increased over time, whereas isolation decreased. These positive spatial changes were accompanied by a 1.6-fold increase in mean subpopulation size over the same period. In addition, occupancy and immature-to-female ratio were similarly related to patch attributes in both years, suggesting that there is no extinction debt.

Moreover, it was likely that the extinction debts have been partially paid, given that their global richness patterns were also significantly correlated with contemporary forest variables in the 2000 s (but the absolute magnitudes of the correlation coefficients were usually smaller than those calculated for historical forest variables). By utilizing species-area relationships, spatial extinction-debt magnitudes for the three vertebrate groups at the global scale were estimated and the hotspots of extinction debts were identified.

This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly, and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but unknown) delays-an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple bioclimatic envelope models of climate and habitat suitability with generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We show that (i) as many as four species of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full. Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years.

It has been qualified and elaborated since 1994, mostly in terms of the effects of spatial pattern on the outcomes. The strongest critiques of the concept emphasize that the direct trade-off between competition and colonization abilities is not simple.

J.","Extinction debt or habitat change? - Ongoing losses of woodland birds in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia","The loss, fragmentation and degradation of native vegetation are major causes of loss of biodiversity globally. Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species' declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species' decline in modified landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, fires and the addition of woody debris may also be required.

We examined how predator species composition and increased temperatures affected bac terivorous protist community extinction debt (Mc number of species that will go extinct) and relaxation time (the amount of time it takes for the extinction debt to be paid oft). We found that neither affected relaxation time, but that the presence of a generalist predatory protist species increased extinction debt through its role as a keystone predator. Warming also significantly decreased how long it took communities to lose half of the species that were to eventually go extinct, That this half-relaxation time was shorter in warmed communities than in unwarmed communities in this system indicates that extinctions were front-loaded in the warmed communities compared to the unwarmed communities. Our findings suggest that even if increased temperature is not expected to increase extinction debt, it could still accelerate the rate at which those extinctions will occur. This in turn narrows the time window for taking actions to prevent a large portion of the extinction debt from being paid off. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft ffir Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbII.

The situation in the 18th century, before largescale land transformation, such as river regulations and drainages, could be approximately reconstructed. The species-area relationship was significant for all three classes. We estimated that 1 amphibian species, 4 reptile species, and 230 species of birds have become extinct in Hungary during the last two centuries. The latter seems unrealistic, so we evatuated extinctions in raptors (Fatconiformes) which was the best known taxon. According to our estimation, there should be 23 extinct species of raptors in Hungary. However, we found only 14 potential species, even when considering unlikely species. Therefore, we conclude that the present species richness pattern in the reserves may have not reached equilibrium for several taxa (tike birds), but probably has done so for others (amphibians and reptiles). Although, it would be desirable to extend the analysis to other taxa, this result indicates the existence of time-delayed species extinctions after habitat destruction, that is, an extinction debt. Currently, few studies have reported a timedelay effect from Europe. However, the results of this study suggest that an extinction debt may be important and should be considered when developing conservation strategies. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Many plant species persist in habitat fragments via persistent life cycle stages such as seed banks, generating a species extinction debt. Here, seed banks are hypothesized to cause a temporal delay in the expected loss of genetic variation, which can be referred to as a genetic extinction debt, as a possible mechanism behind species extinction debts.Methods Fragmented grassland populations of Campanula rotundifolia were examined for evidence of a genetic extinction debt, investigating if the seed bank contributed to the extinction debt build-up. The genetic make-up of 15 above-and below-ground populations was analysed in relation to historical and current levels of habitat fragmentation, both separately and combined.Key Results Genetic diversity was highest in above-ground populations, though below-ground populations contained 8 % of unique alleles that were absent above-ground. Above-ground genetic diversity and composition were related to historical patch size and connectivity, but not current patch characteristics, suggesting the presence of a genetic extinction debt in the above-ground populations. No such relationships were found for the belowground populations. Genetic diversity measures still showed a response to historical but not present landscape characteristics when combining genetic diversity of the above-and below-ground populations.Conclusions The fragmented C. rotundifolia populations exhibited a genetic extinction debt. However, the role of the seed banks in the build-up of this extinction debt is probably small, since the limited, unique genetic diversity of the seed bank alone seems unable to counter the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation on the population genetic structure of C. rotundifolia.",NA,NA,2017,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","2017 SEP","ANNALS OF BOTANY",120,"3","373","385","10.1093/aob/mcx057","0305-7364 and 1095-8290","WOS:000410236600007","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Plue, Jan et al.

Delayed responses of plant occurrence have recently received great attention, particularly in conservation, although evidence for extinction debts is incongruent. Here we asked if we could detect an extinction debt for plant species after 100 years of fragmentation, depending on regional or local (gamma or alpha respectively) diversity measure used, and if all plant species or only habitat specialists were investigated. Historical and contemporary grassland patterns were analysed in 33 rural landscapes (each 1 km(2) in diameter) in south-eastern Sweden. Results show that managed semi-natural grassland had declined from 39% to 3% in 100 years. Diversity measured at regional scale was best explained by grassland extent 100 years ago, for both all species and grassland specialists. Present-day management, but neither present nor past grassland extent, was important for grassland specialists' occurrence at the local scale, although present-day grassland proportion had a positive influence on species richness at the local scale. We found evidence of an extinction debt at both local and regional scale when all species were included in the analysis, but not for grassland specialist species at the local scale. However, the extinction debt is still to be settled for grassland specialists at the regional scale, and therefore the estimation of extinction debts in fragmented habitats presents one of the greatest challenges for conservation today and in the future.

In forest ecosystems, the influence of landscape history on contemporary biodiversity patterns has been shown to provide a convenient framework to explain shifts in plant assemblages. However, very few studies have controlled for present human-induced activities when analysing the effect of forest continuity on community structures. By cutting and removing trees, foresters substantially change stand ecological conditions, with consequences on biodiversity patterns. Disentangling the effect of past and present human activities on biodiversity is thus crucial for ecosystem management and conservation.2. We explored the response of plant and springtail species richness and composition to forest continuity (ancient vs. recent) in montane forests, while controlling for stand maturity (mature vs. overmature). We established 70 sites in landscapes dominated by unfragmented ancient forests where we surveyed plants and assessed springtails by analysing environmental DNA.3. Neither plant nor springtail species richness was influenced by forest continuity or by stand maturity. Instead, site-specific characteristics, especially soil properties and canopy openness, were of major importance in shaping above- and below-ground richness.4. For plant and springtail species composition, the effect of forest continuity was mediated by stand maturity. Thus, both plants and springtails showed a convergence in assemblage patterns with the increasing availability of overmature stand attributes. Moreover, soil and stand-scale factors were evidently more important than landscape-scale factors in shaping above- and below-ground species composition.5. Synthesis. We clearly demonstrated that biodiversity patterns are more strongly influenced by present human-induced activities than by past human-induced activities. In the Northern Alps where our study sites were located, the colonization credit of most species has been paid off and the transient biodiversity deficit usually related to forest continuity has moved towards equilibrium. These findings emphasize the necessity to better control for local-scale factors when analysing the response of biodiversity to forest continuity; we call for more research into the effects of forest continuity in unfragmented mountain forests.",NA,NA,2018,"WILEY","2018 JAN","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",106,"1","306","318","10.1111/1365-2745.12808","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000417839700026","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Janssen, Philippe et al.

There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began.METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats.KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off.CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.",NA,NA,2017,"BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC","2017 JAN","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",104,"1","182","189","10.3732/ajb.1600313","0002-9122 and 1537-2197","WOS:000394505200016","PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Niissalo, Matti A. et al.

Historically, in many cases, a narrow view may have allowed species declines to continue, virtually undetected, for long periods of time (perhaps even decades). We suggest that extinction debt is likely responsible for numerous (perhaps most) amphibian declines and that this perspective should be incorporated into the structure of amphibian research and management. Extinction debt, originally proposed to explain changes in species richness following environmental disturbance, also may refer to the proportion of populations of an individual species that is expected to eventually be lost because of habitat change. A conservation framework to address extinction debt focuses research on threats at the individual, population, and metapopulation levels. This approach will help enhance, restore, and protect specific processes and habitats at the proper scale by directing management to the most vulnerable level and stage of a species. We illustrate this approach using Flatwoods Salamanders, Ambystoma cingulatum and Ambystoma bishopi, which occurred historically throughout the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States but have experienced a greater than 85% loss of populations in recent years. Reversal of these losses is possible only if conservation and recovery efforts encompass individual, population, and metapopulation levels. We illustrate our framework by outlining actions that could be taken at each of these levels to help guide conservation and management of amphibians with complex life cycles and provide options for how to prioritize conservation actions in the face of logistical and budgetary shortfalls.",NA,NA,2017,"SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES","2017 MAR","JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY",51,"1","12","18","10.1670/16-090","0022-1511 and 1937-2418","WOS:000393797600003","C/O ROBERT D ALDRIDGE, ST LOUIS UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 3507 LACLEDE, ST LOUIS, MO 63103 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Semlitsch, Raymond D. et al.

Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterfly species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classified butterfly species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found significant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more significant impacts in small patches than in large ones.

The extinction debt will affect the interpretation of ongoing impacts and extinctions, because little is understood about the changes in species abundance through time in remnants following surrounding habitat destruction. In some models, thresholds in mean time to extinction are sensitive to the spatial configuration of the remnants, but changes in abundance through time could also be affected. A simulation that includes hierarchical competition, reproduction, dispersal, and mortality was run on two-phase landscapes varying in spatial pattern and extent of habitat destruction. In this article, the courses of temporal change in species abundance, or trajectories, are examined. Thresholds are not evident among different amounts of extant habitat or across a range of spatial patterns. Instead, trends exist in the amount of impact per unit reduction in habitat. Better competitors are more sensitive to the initial stage of destruction and to destruction leaving a more dispersed pattern of habitat; better colonizers have the opposite trends.

We analyzed this model using analytic and simulation techniques. Relating this analytic model to real-world situations shows that it applies to scattered permanent devegetation of small patches and to across-the-board decreases in fecundity such as could be caused by pollution. For repeated spatially random disturbance, we develop a new model that shows an even more severe extinction-debt effect. For larger fragments of remnant vegetation, such as forest woodlots, we argue that the assumptions of-the model are violated but that an extinction debt nevertheless occurs due to gradual stochastic elimination of species that are very rare and isolated in these fragments. For habitat destruction on regional scales (reduction in ecosystem area without disturbance in remnant areas), one must, in contrast, apply species-area relations based on the distribution of-different habitat types (e.g., elevational and rainfall gradients, physiographic and edaphic variability). Such an analysis predicts rapid, not delayed, loss of all types of species, not just competitive types. We conclude that the extinction-debt effect is real and arises in three different models, but relating the models to real-world conservation problems must be done with care.",NA,NA,1996,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","1996 AUG","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS",6,"3","784","789","10.2307/2269483","1051-0761","WOS:A1996UZ41200024","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loehle, C et al.

However, previous studies have not tried to detect the presence of an extinction debt from individual species loss and colonization rates in an assemblage of plant species. In addition, few researchers have studied extinction debt using factors other than landscape changes [e.g. the impacts of management (mowing or burning), habitat use by large herbivores or climate factors]. In the present study, we examined an extinction debt for vascular plant species by monitoring their survival and colonization dynamics.Location: Abandoned and managed semi-natural grasslands, central Japan, where the area of grasslands has decreased considerably.Methods: We re-surveyed species compositions in the 2000s in plots that had been surveyed in the 1980s, and estimated the impacts of the past (1910s) and recent (1980s-2000s) proportion of the total grassland area and the above-mentioned factors on species dynamics during the past 20yrs using hierarchical Bayesian models.Results: In abandoned grasslands, the past grassland proportion was significantly positively associated with the probabilities of survival of 96% of the grassland specialists and of colonization by 21% of these specialists. The effects of the past grassland proportion on the specialists were much stronger than those of recent grassland proportion and the other factors studied (i.e. herbivores, climate). In managed grasslands, however, the past grassland proportion had little effect on survival of and colonization by specialists from the result that few specialists were significantly affected by past grassland proportion.Conclusions: We found higher probabilities of both survival of and colonization by grassland specialists at sites with larger past habitat areas, which suggests that there is a time lag after habitat loss before the loss of specialists.

Quantifying such extinctions and investigating long-term consequences of perturbations has proven challenging, because perturbations are not isolated and occur across various spatial and temporal scales, from local habitat losses to global warming. Additionally, the relative importance of eco-evolutionary processes varies across scales, because levels of ecological organization, i.e. individuals, (meta)populations and (meta)communities, respond hierarchically to perturbations. To summarize our current knowledge of the scales and mechanisms influencing extinction debts, we reviewed recent empirical, theoretical and methodological studies addressing either the spatio-temporal scales of extinction debts or the eco-evolutionary mechanisms delaying extinctions. Extinction debts were detected across a range of ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with estimates ranging from 9 to 90% of current species richness. The duration over which debts have been sustained varies from 5 to 570 yr, and projections of the total period required to settle a debt can extend to 1000 yr. Reported causes of delayed extinctions are 1) life-history traits that prolong individual survival, and 2) population and metapopulation dynamics that maintain populations under deteriorated conditions. Other potential factors that may extend survival time such as microevolutionary dynamics, or delayed extinctions of interaction partners, have rarely been analyzed. Therefore, we propose a roadmap for future research with three key avenues: 1) the microevolutionary dynamics of extinction processes, 2) the disjunctive loss of interacting species and 3) the impact of multiple regimes of perturbation on the payment of debts. For their ability to integrate processes occurring at different levels of ecological organization, we highlight mechanistic simulation models as tools to address these knowledge gaps and to deepen our understanding of extinction dynamics.",NA,NA,2019,"WILEY","2019 DEC","ECOGRAPHY",42,"12","1973","1990","10.1111/ecog.04740","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000501362200001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Figueiredo, Ludmilla et al.

Within this context, the 'extinction debt' hypothesis brings into question an often assumed relationship between species richness and present-day spatial habitat structure (i.e. extent, fragmentation), suggesting instead that the richness and composition of biological communities may lag behind spatial changes in habitat. We examined evidence for an extinction debt among epiphytic lichens, a highly diverse biological group of significant conservation concern. Using sites in Scotland, we compared epiphyte species richness in smaller-scale habitat units (aspen stands) to larger-scale woodland structure (extent and fragmentation) measured at two spatial scales (1 km(2) and 4 km(2)) and for two timeframes, modern (1990s to 2000s) and historic (1860s to 1880s). Species richness was positively related to woodland extent and negatively related to woodland fragmentation; however, richness was explained better by historic woodland structure at a 1-km(2) scale, than by modern woodland structure. The results indicate: (1) a coupling of stand-scale epiphyte assembly and dynamics of the wider woodland ecosystem, and (2) a significant lag in the response of epiphyte species richness to habitat spatial structure. However, the effect of spatial habitat structure is different between species groups with contrasting traits. The effect of decreasing woodland extent on epiphyte richness is generally more severe for microlichens (comprising a greater number of rare and specialist species) than the more generalist macrolichens.",NA,NA,2007,"WILEY","2007 JAN","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS",13,"1","84","91","10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00310.x","1366-9516 and 1472-4642","WOS:000243403000009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ellis, Christopher J. et al.

EDT posits that in a closed system with a mix of competitor and colonizer species and experiencing habitat fragmentation and loss, the competitor species will show a gradual decline in fitness (occupancy) eventually leading to their extinction (extirpation) over multiple generations. A corollary of this is a colonizer credit, where colonizer species occupancy may increase with fragmentation because the disturbance gives that life history a transient relative competitive advantage. We found that competitor species occupancy decreased in time concomitant with an increase in occupancy of colonizer species and this may be related to habitat fragmentation or loss owing to industrialized bottom trawl fishing. Mean species richness increased over time which suggests less specialization (decreased dominance) of the assemblage that may result from habitat homogenization. These analyses also showed that when abundance of species was decreased by fishing but eventually returned to previous levels, on average it had a lower occupancy than earlier in the series which could increase their vulnerability to depletion by fishing. Changing occupancy and diversity patterns of the community over time is consistent with EDT which can be exacerbated by direct impacts of fishery removals as well as climate change impacts on the fish community assemblage.",NA,NA,2016,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2016 NOV 28","PLOS ONE",11,"11",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0166409","1932-6203","WOS:000389472400024","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Duplisea, Daniel E. et al.

However, both the short- and the long-term effects of contrasting LULC change pathways on this assembly are seldom explored. Objectives To assess how LULC change pathways affect woody plant community parameters (i.e. species richness, diversity and evenness) and species' presence and abundance, compared with environmental factors and neutral processes. Methods The study was performed in Mediterranean limestone scrublands in NE Spain. Cover of each woody species was recorded in 150 scrubland plots belonging to five LULC change pathways along the past century, identified using land-cover maps and fieldwork. For each plot, total woody and herbaceous vegetation cover, local environmental variables and geographical position were recorded. Effects of these pathways and factors on plant community parameters and on species presence and abundance were assessed, considering spatial effects potentially associated to neutral processes. Results Species richness and diversity were associated with LULC change pathways and elevation, while evenness was only associated with this last. Pathways and environmental variables explained similar variance in both species' presence and cover. In general, while community parameters were affected by recent-past (1956) use, species presence and abundance were associated with far-past (pre-1900) cropping. No relevant spatial effect was detected for any studied factor.

Although these grasslands are now protected under the EU Habitats Directive, many species in the remaining habitat patches are still declining. Recent studies suggest that species across different taxa may become extinct with a substantial time delay, even without further habitat loss. Consequently, there might be an extinction debt, which poses a major challenge for conservation. Here, we analysed the response of plant, grasshopper and butterfly species richness in calcareous grasslands to habitat fragmentation over the last five decades. In this study, habitat area and connectivity have undergone a marked decline between 1970 and 1990 but have only slightly declined during the last three decades. Despite this, the current richness of specialist and generalist species among plants and butterflies was equally or better explained by past than present landscape conditions. This finding indicates the existence of an extinction debt in both taxa in the still well-connected grasslands of the study area. We conclude that increased conservation measures since the 1990s have favoured species persistence, despite severe habitat loss in the more distant past. By contrast, grasshopper diversity weakly responded to habitat area and connectivity; rather it is likely to depend mainly on habitat quality. To inhibit future extinctions, it is crucial to maintain large-scale patches by traditional land-use practices (i.e. rough grazing or mowing once a year), as well as restore former habitat to facilitate species dispersal in fragmented landscapes.",NA,NA,2020,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","2020 JUN","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION",246,NA,"108588","108588","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108588","0006-3207 and 1873-2917","ZOOREC:ZOOR15608056060","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Loeffler, Franz et al.

We used generalized linear models and model selection to determine which time period best predicted the contemporary species richness patterns.Woody grasslands showed time lags of 20-40 years. Contemporary open grassland communities were, generally, associated with more contemporary landscapes.

Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe.The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The results of this study have implications for forest management practices. Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of habitats for butterflies and other organisms.

To investigate how plant species richness is shaped by both present and historical landscape configuration and local environmental conditions in fragmented calcareous grasslands, 64 sites in Southern Belgium were surveyed for their total species richness and environmental characteristics. Species were subdivided in specialist and generalist groups and the former were clustered into emergent groups (EGs) according to 16 relevant life-history traits. Four specialist emergent groups were derived: orchids, rosette species, annuals and half-rosette species. Both specialist and generalist species richness increased with present fragment area, while present fragment connectivity only affected the number of specialist species. This trend was maintained for most EGs, although habitat area was mostly more important than connectivity. All species groups responded to an insolation gradient, except EGs of rosette and annual species. Differential response to fragmentation among emergent groups could be interpreted in terms of dispersal and persistence traits. No relation between species richness and historical area or connectivity was found, making an extinction debt unlikely. Hence, present-day variation in plant species diversity seems to be no legacy of past landscape configuration. Our results clearly indicate that plant species may be quickly lost in response to new fragmentation events. To restore plant diversity, management should focus both on mitigating landscape fragmentation and restoring habitat quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although time-lagged responses of species to landscape change have been widely recognized, few studies have empirically evaluated which of these two processes is more closely related to extinction debt (i.e., postponed species extinction following habitat loss). This study aimed to understand the underlying processes of extinction debt by partitioning beta-diversity into components of species nestedness and species turnover. We measured grassland species richness at three spatial extents in a highly fragmented semi-natural grassland landscape in Japan. Dissimilarity-based beta-diversity was partitioned into two components (i.e., nestedness-resultant dissimilarity [beta (sne)] and turnover-resultant dissimilarity [beta (sim)]), which were further analyzed using principal coordinates analyses (PCoA). The relationships between the variability of PCoA axis 1 scores and the current and past habitat proportions were evaluated. A significant positive relationship between current grassland species richness and past (i.e., the 1910s) grassland proportion was found at the largest spatial extent. The first axis of PCoA based on beta (sne) showed significant correlation with past habitat proportions, whereas the PCoA axis based on beta (sim) showed no significant correlation with either the current or past habitat proportions. A non-random loss of grassland species represented by nestedness underlay the extinction debt found at the landscape level.

We evaluated whether habitat suitability models can be used in conjunction with species-area relationships (SAR) to detect apparent extinction debts as implicated by the conservation status assigned to bird species.LocationKwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.MethodsWe modelled historic distributions of coastal forests using MaxEnt, a presence-only technique for modelling species distributions. The model provided an estimate of forest loss. We then conducted 293 point counts to survey birds within remaining forest fragments and employed an information-theoretic framework to test for the best fit SAR model. Extinction debts were calculated using the estimate of forest loss and the empirical SAR data.ResultsOur model suggests extensive forest loss (82%) within a naturally fragmented landscape. The power function provided the best fit for bird SAR. Fourteen bird species are predicted to go extinct from coastal forests. Predicted extinctions closely matched the number of threatened species locally but not globally. Predicted extinctions also only matched globally threatened species that reach their northernmost distribution limit within coastal forests, but not species that reach their southernmost distribution limit here.Main conclusionsWe found that habitat suitability models could be used in conjunction with SAR to estimate extinction debt implied by conservation statuses of extant species. Our approach assumed that forest loss drives extinction debts but also provided the opportunity to link forest loss and the likelihood of extinction.

Although local habitat history can modulate the existence of extinction debt (i.e., the number of populations predicted to become extinct) in a landscape, its role in detecting extinction debt has not been examined explicitly. We aimed to compare the detectability of extinction debt among populations of an endangered semi-natural grassland species, Echinops setifer (Compositae), in the grassland landscape of Mt. Aso, Japan. We classified populations into three groups that differed in local habitat history: stable (habitat loss ae<currency>30% since the 1930s), moderately decreased (30% < loss ae<currency> 90%), and severely decreased (loss > 90%). We then evaluated whether the effects of habitat areas during the 1930s and 2000s varied among groups to explain population size by GLMMs and estimated coefficient of explanatory variable by Bayesian MCMC methods. Within the groups, stable group showed significant positive relationships with both past and current habitat areas. The moderately decreased group only showed significant positive relationships with past habitat areas, indicating the existence of extinction debt in these populations. The severely decreased group only showed significant positive relationships with current habitat areas, indicating that they may have already paid their extinction debt because the rate of grassland loss exceeded the extinction threshold.

The length of the relaxation time until this 'extinction debt' is paid (i.e., until extinctions cease) depends on the ecosystem, species group and extent of fragmentation. Studies of grassland ecosystems have revealed that plant extirpations after fragmentation can occur rapidly when the degree of fragmentation is high. Studies of extinction debt in highly fragmented forests, however, are lacking. In this study, we evaluated the existence of an extinction debt in the Prignitz, Brandenburg, Germany, where 94% of the semi-natural forests have vanished since 1780. We surveyed the herb-layer species of 104 forest patches and fitted species richness as a function of the historical and present-day patch configurations. Models including the present-day habitat area and connectivity explained the present day species richness better than models including historical patch-configuration variables. There was no significant effect of the historical habitat area on the present day species richness. However, the effect of historical patch connectivity on the richness of forest specialists with short-distance dispersal potential was significant when excluding present-day habitat area from the models and habitat quality and heterogeneity were used as covariables. The extinction debt has largely been paid after approximately 160 years of relaxation time which contrasts with previous studies of temperate forests that have found extinction debts persisting 120-225 years after fragmentation. We demonstrate that extinction debts in temperate forests may be paid off more rapidly if the degree of fragmentation is high. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We tested whether current species richness and composition would be more related to past or to recent natural vegetation cover. We then defined trajectories of vegetation loss and tested whether different attributes (frequency, magnitude and duration of disturbance) affected particular species and functional groups. We found that current species richness and composition were more related to past than to current vegetation cover. However, we also observed that responses of particular species and functional groups were dependent on specific trajectory attributes. We concluded that present fish community characteristics may respond not only to past watershed conditions but also to how watershed conditions have changed over the time.

To this end, metacommunity theory has developed to better understand the complexity of local and regional interactions that occur across larger landscapes. While metacommunity ecology has now provided several alternative models of species coexistence at different spatial scales, predictions regarding the consequences of landscape alteration have been done exclusively for the competition-colonization trade off model (CC). In this paper we investigate the effects of landscape perturbation on source-sink metacommunities. We show that habitat destruction perturbs the equilibria among species competitive effects within the metacommunity, driving both direct extinctions and an indirect extinction debt. As in CC models, we found a time lag for extinction following habitat destruction that varied in length depending upon the relative importance of direct and indirect effects. However, in contrast to CC models, we found that the less competitive species are more affected by habitat destruction. The best competitors can sometimes even be positively affected by habitat destruction, which corresponds well with the results of field studies. Our results are complementary to those results found in CC models of metacommunity dynamics. From a conservation perspective, our results illustrate that landscape alteration jeopardizes species coexistence in patchy landscapes through complex indirect effects and delayed extinctions patterns.",NA,NA,2011,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2011 MAR 8","PLOS ONE",6,"3",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0017567","1932-6203","DRCI:DATA2013082003639958","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Mouquet, Nicolas et al.

It results in the transformation of continuous (hence large) habitat patches into isolated (hence smaller) patches, embedded in a matrix of another habitat type. Many populations are harmed by fragmentation because remnant patches do not fulfil their ecological and demographic requirements. In turn, this leads to a loss of biodiversity, especially if species have poor dispersal abilities. Moreover, landscape fragmentation is a dynamic process in which patches can be converted from one type of habitat to another. A recently created habitat might suffer from a reduced biodiversity because of the absence of adapted species that need a certain amount of time to colonize the new patch (e.g. direct meta-population effect). Thus landscape dynamics lead to complex habitat spatiotemporal structured, in which each patch is more or less continuous in space and time. In this study, we define habitat spatial structure as the degree to which a habitat is isolated from another habitat of the same kind and temporal structure as the time since the habitat is in place. Patches can also display reduced biodiversity because their spatial or temporal structures are correlated with habitat quality (e.g. indirect effects). We discriminated direct meta-community effects from indirect (habitat quality) effects of the spatiotemporal structure of habitats on biodiversity using Collembola as a model. We tested the relative importance of spatial and temporal structure of habitats for collembolan diversity, taking soil properties into account. In an agroforested landscape, we set up a sampling design comprised of two types of habitats (agriculture versus forest), a gradient of habitat isolation (three isolation classes) and two contrasting ages of habitats. Our results showed that habitat temporal structure is a key factor shaping collembolan diversity. A reduced diversity was detected in recent habitats, especially in forests. Interactions between temporal continuity and habitat quality were also detected by taking into account soil properties: diversity increased with soil carbon content, especially in old forests. Negative effects of habitat age on diversity were stronger in isolated patches. We conclude that habitat temporal structure is a key factor shaping collembolan diversity, while direction and amplitude of its effect depend on land use type and spatial isolation.

A case study of antagonistic butterfly larvae-plant networks","Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species richness in fragmented habitats and can lead to immediate or time-delayed species extinctions. Asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt between interacting species may have severe effects on ecological networks. However, these effects remain largely unknown. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch and landscape changes on antagonistic butterfly larvae-plant trophic networks in Mediterranean grasslands in which previous studies had shown the existence of extinction debt in plants but not in butterflies. We sampled current species richness of habitat-specialist and generalist butterflies and vascular plants in 26 grasslands. We assessed the direct effects of historical and current patch and landscape characteristics on species richness and on butterfly larvae-plant trophic network metrics and robustness. Although positive species- and interactions-area relationships were found in all networks, structure and robustness was only affected by patch and landscape changes in networks involving the subset of butterfly specialists. Larger patches had more species (butterflies and host plants) and interactions but also more compartments, which decreased network connectance but increased network stability. Moreover, most likely due to the rescue effect, patch connectivity increased host-plant species (but not butterfly) richness and total links, and network robustness in specialist networks. On the other hand, patch area loss decreased robustness in specialist butterfly larvae-plant networks and made them more prone to collapse against host plant extinctions. Finally, in all butterfly larvae-plant networks we also detected a past patch and landscape effect on network asymmetry, which indicates that there were different extinction rates and extinction debts for butterflies and host plants. We conclude that asynchronies in extinction and extinction debt in butterfly-plant networks provoked by patch and landscape changes caused changes in species richness and network links in all networks, as well as changes in network structure and robustness in specialist networks.",NA,NA,2018,"WILEY","2018 JUN","OIKOS",127,"6","803","813","10.1111/oik.04536","0030-1299 and 1600-0706","WOS:000434153600005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Guardiola, Moises et al.

Grasslands cover large areas of many countries, provide high levels of provisioning ecosystem services and are an important habitat for many species. While grasslands are often anthropogenic in nature, human-induced environmental perturbations are acknowledged threats to their biodiversity and functioning. Using a repeat survey of grassland plots in Scotland, UK we identified long-term changes in community composition and species indices over a 40 year period (1973-2013).Scottish grasslands were found to have changed significantly over this time. Species richness increased, while diversity declined as dominant species increased in cover. Nitrogen-demanding and moisture-requiring species increased, possibly reflecting increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition and rainfall over this time. In Acid and Nardus grasslands species with low tolerance to very acidic soils increased, possibly reflecting a decrease in sulphur deposition. Overall beta-diversity showed no change, indicating that contrary to trends in other habitats, homogenisation has not occurred. In general bryophytes and low-growing forb and grass species declined while taller species increased. This may reflect either the decline in grazing in recent years or the increase in atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Species richness increased but the majority of species declined in cover while a few dominant species increased suggesting that an extinction debt may be establishing.

Detecting such extinction debts opens opportunities to counteract future biodiversity loss, yet knowing the underlying causes of population declines is a basic need for targeting specific guidelines for conservation and restoration (e.g. habitat quantity, quality or connectivity). Here, we examine the extinction debt in the common Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) occurring in woodland patches of a highly fragmented region that has lost nearly half of the remnant woodland cover during the last 50years (1956-2002). We sampled myrtle occurrence in 304 woodland patches and modelled its probability of occurrence in relation to patch size, patch disturbance and woodland cover in the surrounding landscape. In order to test for extinction debt evidence, we tested whether myrtle occurrence is better predicted by past (1956) than by present (2002) woodland cover. We found that the probability of myrtle occurrence is associated with present patch features (size and disturbance) that are linked to causes of individual mortality and/or recruitment collapse. However, it was associated with past - rather than present - woodland cover in the surrounding landscape, proving a still unpaid extinction debt. Specifically, myrtle occurrence is very unlikely in small and highly disturbed patches located in long-term deforested landscapes.Synthesis and applications. Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity. However, these populations still offer management opportunities, and reducing disturbances and improving habitat quality, especially within small woodland patches, should be a top priority for conservation and restoration.Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity.

In this study, we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be found in clear-cuts after at least 80years as coniferous production forest by comparing floras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits reflecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land use. Clear-cuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36% higher species richness and 35% higher richness of grassland indicator species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory, compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction debts of the flora, these young forests offer opportunities for grassland restoration at large scales.

Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate.LocationBonga, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia.MethodsWe studied 50 trees that had been isolated for periods ranging from a few years to half a century after clearing. The trees were now located in the agricultural landscape at different distances from intact Afromontane forests. Fourteen trees in the forests were used as references. Each tree was inventoried for all vascular epiphytic plants, mosses and liverworts.ResultsTime since clearance had a direct negative effect on number of forest specialist species via delayed extinctions and the detected large extinction debt of both bryophytes and vascular plants continued to be paid over several decades. However, time since clearance had an indirect positive effect on number of forest indicator species via the reappearance of shade from coffee planted surrounding the trees, even if the waiving effect on the extinction debt was rather small. Additionally, trees at further distances from the forest edge had fewer forest-associated species.Main conclusionsOur results show that the ability of agroecological landscapes to foster forest biodiversity may be overestimated if meta-community processes over time and space are not taken into account.

We evaluated coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping for the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, marsupials, rodents and sigmodontine rodents separately. beta-diversity based on the multiplicative model was used to estimate the number of compartments (groups of sites with similar species composition) in Clementsian structures, and cluster analysis identified which sites formed compartments. Canonical correspondence analysis determined which environmental factors were associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Distance-decay analysis evaluated the spatial structure in small mammal and environmental data, and Mantel tests evaluated correlations between them.Results Rodent metacommunities had Clementsian structure, whereas marsupials had Gleasonian structure. Compartment locations for rodents were consistent with areas of endemism. Temperature seasonality was most associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Assemblage and environmental dissimilarity among sites had significant positive relationships with geographic distance.Main conclusions Compartment locations in Clementsian structures mirrored historical refugium locations and important vicariance events associated with large rivers. Despite extensive deforestation in Atlantic Forest, small mammal distributions are consistent with expectations based on historical biogeography, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have not yet greatly affected geographic distributions of emergent metacommunity structures.

We propose a metapopulation model that combines local colonization within habitat islands and long-distance colonization between islands. We study how regional occupancy dynamics are affected by the multiscale colonization process. We find that the island size distribution (ISD) is a key driver of the long-term occupancy dynamics. When the ISD is heterogeneousthat is, when the size of islands is variablewe show that extinction dynamics become very slow. We demonstrate that this behavior is unrelated to the well-known extinction debt near the critical extinction threshold. Hence, this finding questions the equivalence between extinction debt and critical transitions in the context of metapopulation collapse. Furthermore, we show that long-distance colonization can rescue small islands from extinction and sustain a steady regional occupancy.

This phenomenon is known as extinction debt, which can lead to the underestimation of actual threats to biodiversity. To adequately estimate the condition of recently fragmented plant communities and avoid future loss of species, good indicators of forthcoming extinctions are needed.We studied the behaviour of genetic diversity of a relatively common habitat specialist grass Briza media in fragmented calcareous grasslands in which the extinction debt has been previously documented. Species richness in this system is shown to be determined by historical landscape patterns and human population densities prevailing centuries ago. We hypothesize that genetic diversity in this grassland system is related to current landscape patterns and contemporary human impact since genetic diversity might react more quickly to environmental changes than species diversity.In contrast to species diversity, genetic diversity was indeed best described by current connectivity of grasslands. Additionally, genetic diversity was negatively related to current human population density, indicating an adverse effect of contemporary human settlements on studied species. The faster response of genetic diversity to changed environmental conditions compared to species richness was further supported by the absence of an expected correlation between species richness and genetic diversity.Human population density a century ago had a positive effect on genetic diversity. A similar effect has been demonstrated for species richness in these grasslands, indicating that traditional land use in the past has supported the development of both genetic and species diversity.Synthesis. Genetic diversity of Briza media in fragmented communities is reacting quickly to changes in landscape structure and anthropogenic pressure. Our results confirm that plant species can be prone to genetic deterioration due to habitat fragmentation and negative anthropogenic impact even if the decline in species richness has been delayed by extinction debt. Thus, a decrease of population genetic diversity in fragmented communities can be taken as the first indication of future species losses.",NA,NA,2009,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC","2009 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",97,"6","1329","1336","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01572.x","0022-0477","WOS:000270787100023","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Helm, Aveliina et al.

The dynamic nature of beta diversity (spatial variation in species composition) that derives from such temporal species turnover, however, has received relatively little attention. Here, we disentangled extinction and colonization components of beta diversity by using the sets of species that went locally extinct and that newly colonized the study sites. We applied this concept of extinction and colonization beta diversity to ground vegetation communities that have been repeatedly surveyed in forests where fire and harvesting were experimentally applied. We first found that fire and harvesting caused no effect on beta diversity 2 yr after the treatments. From this result, we might conclude that they did not alter the ways in which species assemble across space. However, when we analyzed the extinction and colonization beta diversity between pre-treatment and 2 yr after the treatments, both measures were found to be significantly lower in burned sites compared to unburned sites (i.e., the groups of excluded and newly colonized species both showed low beta diversity in the burned sites). These results indicate that the fire excluded similar subsets of species across space, making communities become more heterogeneous, but at the same time induced spatially uniform colonization of new species, causing communities to homogenize. Consequently, the effects of these two processes canceled each other out. The relative importance of extinction and colonization components per se also changed temporally after the treatments. Fire and harvesting showed synergetic negative impacts on extinction beta diversity between pre-treatment and 10 yr after the treatments. Overall, analyses using extinction and colonization beta diversity allowed us to detect nonrandom disassembly and reassembly dynamics in ground vegetation communities. Our results suggest that common practices of analyzing beta diversity at one point in time can mask significant variation driven by disturbance.

Understanding of the processes building an extinction debt is fundamentally important for explaining present and future diversity patterns of species in fragmented landscapes. Few empirical studies, however, have examined the responses of different plant functional groups (PFGs) to historical landscape changes. We aimed to reveal PFG-based differences in species' persistence by focusing on their vegetative, reproductive, and dispersal traits. We examined whether the present distributions of PFGs of grassland species in the edges of remnant woodlands established on former semi-natural grasslands are related to the past surrounding landscapes at different time periods and spatial scales. The effects of past landscapes varied significantly among the PFGs. Richness of short, early flowering forbs and tall, late-flowering, wind-dispersed forbs showed significant positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions more than 50 years ago (the 1950s) and at wide spatial scales (more than 1 km(2)). Richness of tall, late-flowering forbs with unassisted and other types of dispersal mechanisms showed positive relationships with the surrounding habitat proportions in recent times (the 1970s) and at smaller spatial scales (0.25 km(2)). Our results suggested that plant growth form, flowering season and dispersal ability-with additional information on seed bank persistence-can be good indicators for identifying species' specific sensitivity to surrounding habitat loss.

However, the phenomenon of delayed extinctions as a result of habitat loss has rarely been assessed on oceanic islands. In this study, we tested whether extinction debt (ED), in general, occurs on islands and for which taxonomical groups this phenomenon is most pronounced by assessing ED for multiple endemic taxa and for each of the main altitudinal ecosystems in a well-studied oceanic archipelago.Location: Canary Islands.Methods: We characterized habitat preferences for all endemic species of several taxonomic groups (vascular plants, ground and darkling beetles, flies and land snails). Using generalized linear mixed models and available data about habitat distributions, we tested for all taxa and habitat types to determine whether past habitat area better explained current richness of habitat specialists than current habitat area. If so, an extinction debt can be assumed.Results: For all five major habitat types and five taxonomic groups studied, present-day richness of habitat specialists fitted better with past than current habitat area, evidencing habitat-and taxon-specific extinction debts. This pattern was consistent for both long-lived vascular plants and short-lived invertebrates. Single island endemics in each taxonomic group showed steeper slopes of the species-area relationship (SAR) compared to archipelago endemics indicating higher sensitivity to habitat loss which might increase sizes of ED.Conclusion: Despite differences in species' generation times, plants and invertebrates showed delayed extinctions after habitat destruction in the Canary Islands. Our SAR approach suggests that a considerable number of Canary Island endemics will eventually become extinct in the future without further habitat loss.

"ref_129","JOUR",NA,"Spalding, Christopher and Hull, Pincelli M.","Towards quantifying the mass extinction debt of the Anthropocene","To make sense of our present biodiversity crises, the modern rate of species extinctions is commonly compared to a benchmark, or 'background,' rate derived from the fossil record. These estimates are critical for bounding the scale of modern diversity loss, but are yet to fully account for the fundamental structure of extinction rates through time. Namely, a substantial fraction of extinctions within the fossil record occurs within relatively short-lived extinction pulses, and not during intervals characterized by background rates of extinction. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to compare the modern event to these pulses than to the long-term average rate. Unfortunately, neither the duration of extinction pulses in the geological record nor the ultimate magnitude of the extinction pulse today is resolved, making assessments of their relative sizes difficult. In addition, the common metric used to compare current and past extinction rates does not correct for large differences in observation duration. Here, we propose a new predictive metric that may be used to ascertain the ultimate extent of the ongoing extinction threat, building on the observation that extinction magnitude in the marine fossil record is correlated to the magnitude of sedimentary turnover. Thus, we propose that the ultimate number of species destined for extinction today can be predicted by way of a quantitative appraisal of humanity's modification of ecosystems as recorded in sediments-that is, by comparing our future rock record with that of the past.

However, many species exhibit a delayed response to environmental changes because of the slow intrinsic dynamics of populations, resulting in extinction debt. We assess directly the changes in habitat characteristic species composition by comparing historical (1923) and current inventories in highly fragmented grasslands. We aim to characterize the species that constitute extinction debt in European calcareous grasslands. Location Europe, Estonia, 5960 degrees N, 2425 degrees E. Methods We related eleven life-history traits and selected habitat preferences to local extinctions of populations in grasslands where extinction debt has been largely paid. Traits were chosen to describe species dispersal and persistence abilities and were quantified from databases. Results The studied grasslands have lost 90% of their area and 30% of their characteristic plant populations in 90 years. Species more prone to local population extinction were characterized by shorter life span, self-pollination, a lack of clonal growth, fewer seeds per shoot, lower average height, lower soil nitrogen preference and higher requirements for light, indicating a limited ability to tolerate the range of changes in biotic and abiotic conditions of the sites. Locally extinct populations were also characterized by wind-dispersed seeds, lower seed weight and lower terminal velocity of seeds, suggesting that species strategies for long-distance dispersal are not favoured in highly fragmented landscapes. Thus, both increased habitat isolation and decreased habitat quality are important in determining local population extinction. Main conclusions Populations more prone to local extinction were characterized by a number of life-history traits, demonstrating a greater extinction risk for species with poorer abilities for local persistence and competition.

However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reflect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterflies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75 years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterflies (those not confined to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterflies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern.

Forest primate species exhibited a classic species-area relationship (S = cA(z)) with forest habitat across African countries I conducted three tests based on the species-area relationship that indicate extinction debts are likely to exist in African forest primates; in particular several national extinctions should have already occurred solely as a result of forest loss in the last 50 years (if extinctions occurred simultaneously with habitat loss), but none of these extinctions have yet taken place. I also used the species-area relationship to predict the number of species that make up the total debt accumulated since deforestation began in these countries.

Because of a lack of temporal data, long-term impacts are generally investigated less frequently than short-term impacts. However, these effects are equally important for understanding biodiversity loss. We developed a Bayesian Island Biogeography model combining historical imagery and current species distribution to investigate the long-term impacts of urbanization-induced habitat loss and isolation on birds. We surveyed 101 bird species in 43 urban forest patches in a South American city with different combinations of size, isolation, and time since the last abrupt change in area. Based on the current and historical landscape configuration, we estimated the temporal dynamics between species extinction rate and area, and between immigration rate and isolation. Additionally, we used model parameters to forecast bird extinction debts. Large patches had lower extinction rates than small patches, and immigration rates were lower in more isolated patches. Furthermore, current bird species richness was better explained by current landscape configuration than by past configuration, suggesting that birds rapidly respond to changes in urban landscapes and there are no apparent extinction debts. Indeed, we found that habitat loss reduces species diversity to a new equilibrium in relatively short period (less than 10 years), and model projections indicate that bird richness will remain similar to the present if patch area is maintained.

With networks typically occurring as local interaction networks interconnected in space (a meta-network), we may ask how the loss of specific habitat fragments affects the overall robustness of the meta-network. To address this question, for an empirical meta-network of plants, herbivores and natural enemies we simulated the removal of habitat fragments in increasing and decreasing order of area, age and connectivity for plant extinction and the secondary extinction of herbivores, natural enemies and their interactions. Meta-network robustness was characterized as the area under the curve of remnant species or interactions at the end of a fragment removal sequence. To pinpoint the effects of fragment area, age and connectivity, respectively, we compared the observed robustness for each removal scenario against that of a random sequence. The meta-network was more robust to the loss of old (i.e. long-fragmented), large, connected fragments than of young (i.e. recently fragmented), small, isolated fragments. Thus, young, small, isolated fragments may be particularly important to the conservation of species and interactions, while contrary to our expectations larger, more connected fragments contribute little to meta-network robustness. Our findings highlight the importance of young, small, isolated fragments as sources of species and interactions unique to the regional level. These effects may largely result from an unpaid extinction debt, in which case these fragments are likely to lose species over time. Yet, there may also be more long-lasting effects from cultivated lands (e.g. water, fertilizers and restricted cattle grazing) and network complexity in small, isolated fragments. Such fragments may sustain important biological diversity in fragmented landscapes, but maintaining their conservation value may depend on adequate restoration strategies. To build the meta-network we considered all plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions (as presence-absence data) recorded in 14 habitat fragments, which involved plant species (herbs and shrubs), endophagous herbivores (gall makers or gall inquilines, and leaf miners), ectophagous herbivores (scale insects and aphids), and their natural enemies (parasitoids, hyperparasitoids and predators). To explore fragment contribution to meta-network robustness, we sorted the 14 habitat fragments according to their area, age and six connectivity metrics combining geographical distances among fragments, neighboring area and similarity in plant resources among fragments. For each fragment removal, we considered secondary extinctions of herbivores and tertiary extinctions of natural enemies as consequence of the local extinction of plant resource, and calculated remnant species richness and trophic interactions. We calculated meta-network robustness as the area under the curve of remnant species and interactions for a specific removal sequence for each trophic guild and interaction type. Finally, we compared observed robustness for each removal rule against calculated robustness for 100 random fragment removals.

A.","Extinction debt and the role of static and dynamical fragmentation on biodiversity","The mass-extinction events caused by human-driven habitat loss are a current concern in conservation science. However, the observed number of extinctions is considerably smaller than predicted. The overestimation of extinction rates comes from the time-delay which depends on the species sensitivity to habitat changes. The standard method of predicting the effect of habitat loss on biodiversity is to use the species-area relationship and progressively following it backwards to smaller areas. The difference between the actual number of species and the one provided by the backwards species-area relationship is dubbed extinction debt. Previous studies in general adopt a static view for the spatial distribution of species. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the problem urges us to adopt a dynamic framework to this issue since the time between disturbances of the landscape plays an active role in influencing the strength of the extinction debt. In this context, here we address two distinct approaches for this question: a static and a dynamic view of fragmentation. In the former we quantify the extinction debt in a quenched spatial distribution of species, whereas in the latter the community is let to evolve between disturbance events of the landscape. Here we show that the size of the extinction debt depends on the pattern of the fragmentation. It is found that random distributions of destroyed habitats provide larger extinction debts than those obtained for contiguous areas of fragmentation. Furthermore, in the dynamic approach it is observed that dispersal can lead to unexpected outcomes such as lower biodiversity levels than ones inferred from the backwards species-area relationship.

These ""surviving but ultimately doomed"" species represent an extinction debt. Calculating the magnitude of such future extinction events has been hampered by potentially inaccurate assumptions about the slope of species-area relationships, which are habitat- and taxon-specific. We overcome this challenge by applying a method that uses the historical sequence of deforestation in the Azorean Islands, to calculate realistic and ecologically-adjusted species-area relationships. The results reveal dramatic and hitherto unrecognized levels of extinction debt, as a result of the extensive destruction of the native forest:> 95%, in < 600 yr. Our estimations suggest that more than half of the extant forest arthropod species, which have evolved in and are dependent on the native forest, might eventually be driven to extinction.

For effective wildlife management in urban landscapes, it is essential to consider the complex history of urbanization and its time-delayed effects on species distribution. We examined whether the history of local land use affects the time-delayed response of Japanese hares (Lepus brachyurus) to landscape change in an urban ecosystem by hierarchically reducing the factors affecting differences in the response. We evaluated the occurrence of hares in 62 forest patches along an urban gradient in the Tama Hills area, Japan. Using sites where the surrounding landscape remained relatively stable, we calculated the habitat threshold of hare occurrence based on the surrounding forest area. We extracted sites that used to be suitable for hare occurrence in the past but later on surpassed the identified habitat threshold (i.e., 'regressive sites') and analyzed the landscape factors explaining the extinction debt of hares. Finally, we mapped potential extinction debt throughout the study region. We detected possible extinction debt in 4 regressive sites. We also found that forest patch size and the number of surrounding forest patches were related to hare occurrence. Based on this prediction, several other sites with potential extinction debt were identified in the study region. We found that the delayed response of the Japanese hares is likely caused by differences in forest fragmentation processes at each site.

The small proportion of remaining vegetation and its fragmented and degraded nature will probably mean that a long-term extinction debt will have to be paid. For some species this will be through the process of successive extinctions of sub-populations and lack of recolonization due to poor dispersal ability, leading to ultimate extinction of the metapopulation. However, many bird species in Australia travel locally and regionally to exploit resources that vary in time and space (rich-patch nomads), and appear to be quite capable of dispersing in fragmented landscapes. Many of these too are declining and we need to understand the processes involved in their decline. Making the matrix mere hospitable may reverse the declines of the poor dispersers.

A property of these models is the extinction delay,"" a quantitative measure of the time lag in extinction created by species-specific extinction debt. For completeness, three models were constructed to represent the different demographic routes by which deterioration may affect population dynamics. Numerical analysis for two notional life histories indicated that the demographic response to environmental deterioration had a large effect on extinction delay, but a third analysis showed that the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity ultimately characterized its magnitude. A concave decline in carrying capacity produced a large extinction delay while a small delay occurred with a convex decline. Furthermore, our results explore the non-monotonicity of extinction debt with respect to the speed of deterioration. A peak is present at low levels of deterioration, and the height of the peak and the asymptote of delay are affected by both life history parameterizations and the rate of change of the carrying capacity.

Recent studies have revealed that extinction events often occur with a time delay. In ecology, this phenomenon is termed extinction debt. Here we give an overview of the concept of extinction debt and its implications for biodiversity conservation.Extinction debt refers to the phenomenon that populations or species become extinct with a time lag and not immediately after habitat conditions have deteriorated. The causes for the occurrence of extinction debt can vary widely. In the simplest case, a long-lived species is no longer able to reproduce as much as would be necessary for the longterm survival of its population.The time delay between the occurrence of the environmental change and the extinction event may result in a lack of identification or a misidentification of the relevant causes.

European dry grasslands are particularly endangered. However, the persistence of populations can temporarily, mitigate species loss - a process referred to as 'extinction debt'. We test this hypothesis using historical and present day habitat maps and current plant biodiversity data collected in the forest-steppe zone of Europe. In 16 5 km x 5 km study sites, representing the landscape heterogeneity of the Kiskunsag region (Hungary), 86 20 m x 20 m vegetation plots were surveyed in open and closed calcareous sand grasslands. Grassland diversity was measured as the number of specialist species, defined by statistical fidelity measures using primary and secondary grassland plots. Landscape context was quantified using the areal extent of semi-natural forest-steppe vegetation in a 300 m neighborhood of the plots, based on recent and historical maps (1783, 1860, 1950s, 1987-1989 and 2005). The number of specialist species was estimated with Poisson generalized linear models using the present landscape context, climatic conditions, and a proxy of soil type as covariates. To test for the effect of historical legacies, Pearson residuals from the present models were tested for significant relationships between the residuals and the historical landscape contexts using linear models.We found that the present landscape context had no significant relationship with the specialist species richness of the primary grassland fragments. However, we found a significant relationship between the historical landscape context of the 19th century and the residuals of the present model. Even though the extent of natural vegetation in the 20th century showed more drastic changes, the landscape context in 1950s and 1987-1989 exhibited no significant statistical relationship with the residuals. This delay of species loss is consistent with the extinction debt hypothesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We resurveyed stands first surveyed in the early 1950s to evaluate the influence of patch size and surrounding land cover on shifts in native plant richness and heterogeneity and to evaluate changes in the relative importance of local site conditions versus the surrounding landscape context as drivers of community composition and structure. Larger forests and those with more surrounding forest cover lost fewer species, were more likely to recruit new species, and had lower rates of homogenization than smaller forests in more fragmented landscapes. Nearby urbanization further reduced both alpha and beta understory diversity. Similarly, understory composition depended strongly on local site conditions in the original survey but only weakly reflected the surrounding landscape composition. By 2005, however, the relative importance of these factors had reversed such that the surrounding landscape structure is now a much better predictor of understory composition than are local site conditions.

However, local extinction of species can occur with a temporal delay following habitat fragmentation, which is termed extinction debt. Many studies about extinction debt rely on community equilibrium from relationships between species richness and habitat variables. We assumed that the distribution of many vascular plant species in the coastal range of south-central Chile is not in equilibrium with the present habitat distribution. The aim of this research is to quantify patterns of habitat loss and to detect extinction debt from relationships between the current richness of different assemblages of vascular plants (considering longevity and habitat specialization) and both past and current habitat variables. The results showed that native forests have been fragmented and reduced by 53%, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.99%, in the study area between 1979 and 2011. Current richness of plant species was mostly explained by past habitat area and connectivity. Past habitat variables explained best richness of long-lived specialist plants, which are characterized by restricted habitat specialization and slower population turnover. We also showed that habitat fragmentation has resulted in a significant reduction in long-lived plant species' dwelling patch sizes (DPS) between 1979 and 2011.

The consensus that has emerged from over two decades of research is that the form of the biodiversity-functioning relationship follows a saturating curve. However, the foundation from which these conclusions are drawn mostly stems from empirical investigations that have not accounted for post-extinction changes in community composition and structure, or how surviving species respond to new circumstances and modify their contribution to functioning. Here, we use marine sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities to experimentally assess whether post-extinction compensatory mechanisms (simulated by increasing species biomass) have the potential to alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relations. Consistent with recent numerical simulations, we find that the form of the biodiversity-function curve is dependent on whether or not compensatory responses are present, the cause and extent of extinction, and species density. When species losses are combined with the compensatory responses of surviving species, both community composition, dominance structure, and the pool and relative expression of functionally important traits change and affect species interactions and behaviour. These observations emphasize the importance of post-extinction community composition in determining the stability of ecosystem functioning following extinction.

Understanding potential extinction debts would allow us to reduce future extinction risk by restoring habitats or implementing conservation actions. Although growing empirical evidence has predicted extinction debts in various ecosystems exposed to direct human disturbances, potential extinction debts in natural ecosystems with minimal direct human disturbance are little studied. Ongoing climate change may cause habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly in natural ecosystems vulnerable to environmental change, potentially leading to future local extinctions. Recent climate change would lead to extended growing season caused by earlier snowmelt in spring, resulting in expansion of shrubby species and thereby habitat loss and fragmentation of mountainous moorlands. We examined the potential extinction debts of species diversity and functional diversity (FD; trait variation or multivariate trait differences within a community) in subalpine moorland ecosystems subjected to few direct human disturbances. Plant species richness for all species and for moorland specialists were primarily explained by the past kernel density of focal moorlands (a proxy for spatial clustering of moorlands around them) but not the past area of the focal moorlands, suggesting potential extinction debt in subalpine moorland ecosystems. The higher kernel density of the focal moorland in the past indicates that it was originally surrounded by more neighborhood moorlands and/or had been locally highly fragmented. Patterns in current plant species richness have been shaped by the historical spatial configuration of moorlands, which have disappeared over time. In contrast, we found no significant relationships between the FD and historical and current landscape variables depicting each moorland. The prevalence of trait convergence might result in a less sensitive response of FD to habitat loss and fragmentation compared to that of species richness.

Despite the scale of this exurban development and its potential negative impact on biodiversity, little is known about how this specific type of land conversion impacts wild pollinators. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild pollinators of the peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of current and historic land use at multiple spatial scales on pollinator community composition within agroecological landscapes that have recently undergone exurban development. We reveal that the overall composition of the wild pollinator community is significantly associated with current local agricultural and natural land cover. Specifically, local agricultural land use was associated with ground-nesting bee community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with cavity-nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive community composition for these two groups in exurban habitats. In contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made up the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated with any particular land use type, likely due to their non-central place foraging strategy. Most interestingly, our results indicate that historic land use remains a significant factor impacting the current abundance of all pollinators in the peach agroecosystem, offering the first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly expanding exurban landscape.",NA,NA,2015,"WILEY","2015 NOV","INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY",8,"6","562","572","10.1111/icad.12139","1752-458X and 1752-4598","WOS:000363862300007","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Cusser, Sarah et al.

An existing model is modified here to represent a difference in niche adaptations as well as the competition-colonization tradeoff. Several landscape metrics are calculated at each iteration. Although the addition of niche differentiation did not change the qualitative outcome of the model, the spatial metrics show that some aspects of landscape structure, i.e., average patch area and proximity, become hyperdynamic and remain so. Small fluctuations in species populations are magnified in their spatial expression because the landscape is simplified. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examined how local processes at the population level contribute to extinction debt, and how cycles of habitat deterioration and recovery may delay extinction. We carried out a demographic analysis of the fate of the grassland perennial Primula veris after the cessation of grassland management, where we used either a unidirectional succession model for forest habitat or a rotation model with a period of forest growth followed by a clear-cut and a new successional cycle. The simulations indicated that P. veris populations may have an extinction time of decades to centuries after a detrimental management change. A survey of the current incidence and abundance of P. veris in sites with different histories of afforestation confirmed the simulation results of low extinction rates. P. veris had reduced incidence and abundance only at sites with at least 100 years of forest cover. Time to extinction in simulations was dependent on the duration of the periods with favourable and unfavourable conditions after management cessation, and the population sizes and growth rates in these periods. Our results thus suggest that the ability of a species to survive is a complex function of disturbance regimes, rates of successional change, and the demographic response to environmental changes. Detailed demographic studies over entire successional cycles are therefore essential to identify the environmental conditions that enable long-term persistence and to design management for species experiencing extinction debts.",NA,NA,2016,"SPRINGER","2016 MAY","OECOLOGIA",181,"1","125","135","10.1007/s00442-016-3569-6","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000374564000012","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lehtila, Kari et al.

To formulate a simple mechanistic model using neutral theory that links extinction debt with the species-area relationship (SAR).Location World-wide.Methods We use the neutral model of biodiversity to describe how a community subject to immigration responds to an insular contraction. We investigate the species richness at different times after the habitat-loss event. We compare this with observed species losses in avian studies.Results From the model, two SARs emerge: one with a shallow slope for a habitat area before habitat loss and another with a steeper slope for the habitats that remain after habitat loss. From these curves, the first predicts imminent extinctions while the second predicts total extinctions. The difference between the two curves gives the delayed extinctions, namely the number of species that are lost during the relaxation of the community to equilibrium. The model agrees well with observed relaxation rates in communities of birds. The lag times for relaxation are often very large, with half-lives in the order of thousands of years for remnant areas above 5000 km(2). In many parameter combinations explored, the majority of extinctions are delayed extinctions, and may exceed imminent extinctions by orders of magnitude.Main conclusions Extinction debt is a major reason for failures to observe extinctions following habitat loss. Our modelling approach supports the view that a significant proportion of extinctions are delayed, so that the predictions of SARs (as currently applied) are liable to underestimate total extinctions.

Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. ""Good practice"" dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species, conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with flooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the long-term, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We specifically investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the >58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height >15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness <100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following largescale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output.

The landscape matrix plays a vital role in supporting species populations. However, the importance of the historical composition and configuration of landscape mosaics has received little attention, with studies focusing on the effects of loss and fragmentation of single (focal) habitat over time. We investigated the importance of historical and contemporary landscape heterogeneity (composition and configuration) to identify how landscape change has, and is continuing to have, an effect on current woodland carabid communities.Location: Lowland Britain.Methods: Carabids were sampled from woodlands in 36 tetrads of 4km(2). Ordination methods analysed current community response to representations of contemporary and historical (1930s) landscape heterogeneity. The effects of 80years of landscape change on current carabid assemblages were compared among tetrads.Results: Results are consistent with an extinction debt; carabid communities correlated significantly with the historical composition and configuration of the landscape, but not contemporary landscape configuration. Community assemblages have been shaped, and many species remain affiliated with landscape conditions that no longer exist, notably, large patches of broadleaf woodland and semi-natural grassland. Recent introduction of conifer plantations has had a negative effect on the abundance of many woodland species. For many common, slow-dispersing species, contemporary and historical landscapes offered sub-optimum woodland coverage indicating a lag effect that exceeds 80years. Increased arable land cover and loss of semi-natural grassland and heathland points towards an ongoing detrimental impact on carabid populations.Main conclusions: Compared with focal-habitat studies, the landscape mosaic approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of widespread landscape change on species communities.

There is increasing evidence for impacts of climate and other drivers on plant community change, and fragmented habitats are predicted to be much less resilient to negative impacts on biodiversity and other services. Within Europe, Scotland's native forests are highly fragmented and now cover 4% of the land after many centuries of degradation and loss, but little is known about how their species composition has changed. We recorded long-term vegetation change (from resurvey data) and examined the relationships with climate, pollutant deposition and grazing as key drivers of change, focusing on four forest types: pine, ash, acid- and base-rich oak birch. All four forest types showed dynamic compositional change during 30-50 years between surveys, with increased species richness and decreased diversity. There was no evidence for homogenisation - the opposite was the case for all except pine (no change). Analyses indicate significant and varied climate, pollution and grazing impacts; NHy deposition showed the most frequent association with species compositional changes.

Location Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Time period 30-0 thousand years before present (kybp). Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30-20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20-10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming) and 10-0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene.

A time delay may be involved in the regional extinction of species, and the number of species that eventually may go extinct in the future is called the ""extinction debt."" In boreal Sweden, we examined whether the number of epiphytic crustose lichens and wood-inhabiting fungi in old-growth forest remnants diverges from species richness levels in forest patches that have been naturally isolated for millennia. An excess of species in forest remnants could indicate the presence of an extinction debt. Observed species richness in 32 old-growth forest remnants (also called woodland key habitats [WKHs]) was compared with predicted species richness. To predict species richness we used regression models based on data from 46 isolated old-growth forest patches in a forest-wetland matrix. The reference landscape is ancient and assumed to reflect the conditions of insular floras in dynamic equilibrium. Stand factors constituted predictive variables in the models. The observed number of lichen species was higher than expected (i.e., an extinction debt among lichens may exist). By contrast, there was no significant difference between observed and expected species richness among wood-inhabiting fungi. The species richness of wood-inhabiting fungi has adjusted to the changes in forest and landscape structure more rapidly than the species richness of lichens. Differences in substrate dynamics between epiphytes on living trees and species growing on decaying logs might explain the difference between species groups. The results also indicate that population densities of red-listed species were low, which may result in continuing extinctions of red-listed species.

Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s.

Here we review the strengths and weaknesses of four unconventional sources of historical ecological data: land survey records, ""legacy"" vegetation data, historical maps and photographs, and herbarium specimens. We discuss recent contributions made using these data sources to understanding the impacts of habitat disturbance and climate change on plant populations and communities, and the duration of extinction-colonization time lags in response to landscape change. Historical data frequently support inferences made using conventional ecological studies (e. g., increases in warm-adapted species as temperature rises), but there are cases when the addition of different data sources leads to different conclusions (e. g., temporal vegetation change not as predicted by chronosequence studies). The explicit combination of historical and contemporary data sources is an especially powerful approach for unraveling long-term consequences of multiple drivers of global change. Despite the limitations of historical data, which include spotty and potentially biased spatial and temporal coverage, they often represent the only means of characterizing ecological phenomena in the past and have proven indispensable for characterizing the nature, magnitude, and generality of global change impacts on plant populations and communities.",NA,NA,2013,"BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC","2013 JUL","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",100,"7","1294","1305","10.3732/ajb.1200503","0002-9122 and 1537-2197","WOS:000321766600006","PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Vellend, Mark et al.

Much of this debate is fueled by recent findings that competition from introduced organisms has driven remarkably few plant species to extinction. Instead, native plant species in invaded ecosystems are often found in refugia: patchy, marginal habitats unsuitable to their nonnative competitors. However, whether the colonization and extinction dynamics of these refugia allow long-term native persistence is uncertain. Of particular concern is the possibility that invasive plants may induce an extinction debt in the native flora, where persistence over the short term masks deterministic extinction trajectories. We examined how invader impacts on landscape structure influence native plant persistence by combining recently developed quantitative techniques for evaluating metapopulation persistence with field measurements of an invaded plant community. We found that European grass invasion of an edaphically heterogeneous California landscape has greatly decreased the likelihood of the persistence of native metapopulations. It does so via two main pathways: (i) decreasing the size of native. refugia, which reduces seed production and increases local extinction, and (ii) eroding the dispersal permeability of the matrix between refugia, which reduces their connectivity. Even when native plant extinction is the deterministic outcome of invasion, the time to extinction can be on the order of hundreds of years. We conclude that the relatively short time since invasion in many parts of the world is insufficient to observe the full impact of plant invasions on native biodiversity.",NA,NA,2013,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES","2013 JAN 29","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",110,"5","1744","1749","10.1073/pnas.1212375110","0027-8424","WOS:000314558100039","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gilbert, Benjamin et al.

Then, we used simulated data sets to assess how ED varied when species lists used to derive species-area relationships had an increasing proportion of undetected species. When species lists were incomplete, ranging from 0.99 to 0.75, 15% fewer wetlands were estimated to have species in ED and, on average, 50% fewer species were expected to go extinct per wetland.

In practice, however, a balance between the two ought to be found, and in managed boreal forests, preservation of woodland key habitats is increasingly used strategy to safeguard biological diversity. According to the Finnish Forests Act, certain Forest Act habitat (FAH) types must be safeguarded, provided they are clearly distinguishable from their surroundings. Furthermore, once the habitat has been identified as a FAH, its special characteristics must not be altered. Both of these aspects contain ambiguities that potentially undermine the practical application of the Act. We designed a replicated sampling study to address these ambiguities at the most common FAH type, riparian habitat of small boreal streams. As response variables we used vascular plants and mosses. We asked (i) how wide is the FAH around small streams that is distinguishable from its surrounding and (ii) how wide buffer strip around the FAH is sufficient for long term to preserve the natural species community composition of the FAH. Results: We found that an average three meters wide strip around the stream constitutes the distinguishable FAH and that a minimum of 45 meters wide buffers on both sides of the stream are needed for the species community composition to remain unaltered. Conclusions: We conclude that 45 meters wide buffers appear sufficient to safeguard vascular plant and moss species communities within the FAH, prevent local populations from extinctions and thus pre-empt extinction debt that would be realised with more narrow buffers. While 45 meters may seem intolerable from the commercial forestry point of view, anything less than that may be intolerable from the point of view of conservation, and thus against the idea of sustainable use of natural resources.",NA,NA,2013,"BioMed Central Ltd","2013 JUL 10","BMC ECOLOGY",13,"24","(10 July 2013)","(10 July 2013)","10.1186/1472-6785-13-24","1472-6785","WOS:000321831400001","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Selonen, Ville A.

Despite increasing research on this global change driver, there are still challenges to forming an effective synthesis. The estimated impact of land-use change on biodiversity can depend on location, research methods, and taxonomic focus, with recent global meta-analyses reaching disparate conclusions. Here, we critically appraise this research body and our ability to reach a reliable consensus. We employ named entity recognition to analyze more than 4000 abstracts, alongside full reading of 100 randomly selected papers. We highlight the broad range of study designs and methodologies used; the most common being local space-for-time comparisons that classify land use in situ. Species metrics including abundance, distribution, and diversity were measured more frequently than complex responses such as demography, vital rates, and behavior. We identified taxonomic biases, with vertebrates well represented while detritivores were largely missing. Omitting this group may hinder our understanding of how land-use change affects ecosystem feedback. Research was heavily biased toward temperate forested biomes in North America and Europe, with warmer regions being acutely underrepresented despite offering potential insights into the future effects of land-use change under novel climates. Various land-use histories were covered, although more research in understudied regions including Africa and the Middle East is required to capture regional differences in the form of current and historical land-use practices. Failure to address these challenges will impede our global understanding of land-use change impacts on biodiversity, limit the reliability of future projections and have repercussions for the conservation of threatened species.

Nonetheless, agroforests in the tropics often result from direct forest conversions, displacing rapidly vanishing and highly biodiverse forests with large carbon stocks, causing undesirable trade-offs. Scientists thus debate whether the promotion of agroforestry in tropical landscapes is a sensible policy. So far, this debate typically fails to consider land-use history, that is, whether an agroforest is derived from forest or from open land. Indeed, 57% of papers which we systematically reviewed did not describe the land-use history of focal agroforestry systems. We further find that forest-derived agroforestry supports higher biodiversity than open-land-derived agroforestry but essentially represents a degradation of forest, whereas open-land-derived agroforestry rehabilitates formerly forested open land. Based on a conceptual framework, we recommend to (a) promote agroforestry on suitable open land, (b) maintain tree cover in existing forest-derived agroforests, and (c) conserve remaining forests.

We tested this hypothesis in southeast Sweden by analysing species occurrence per parish for twelve redlisted lichen species and nine redlisted fungus species in relation with current density of big oaks, the density of oaks in the 1830s and connectivity with parishes with the species present. For most species, the occurrence was positively related with current density of habitat (for 18 species out of 21) and parish area (for 16 species). Historical habitat density was positively related with occurrence for 11 species, while connectivity with current occurrences in the surroundings was positive for the occurrence of 12 species and negative for the occurrence of two. For lichen species the connectivity measure that best explained the variation was at a larger spatial scale as compared to fungus species. Even if the density of old oaks remains in the future, inhabiting species will most likely decline because their distribution patterns are not in equilibrium with the current habitat density. Therefore, to allow long-term persistence of inhabiting species the number of old oaks should be increased. Areas where such an increase is most urgent could be identified based on species occurrence data and current habitat density, but because species data will always be incomplete data on the historical habitat distribution is valuable.",NA,NA,2008,"SPRINGER","2008 SEP","BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION",17,"10","2371","2381","10.1007/s10531-008-9387-3","0960-3115","WOS:000258085400005","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ranius, Thomas et al.

While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss versus fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985 to 2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by the past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns.

We use metapopulations of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia in the United Kingdom as a model system to test for extinction debt in a declining species. We derive parameters for a metapopulation model (incidence function model, IFM) using information from a 625-km(2) landscape where habitat patch occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates for E. aurinia depend on patch connectivity, area, and quality. We then show that habitat networks in six extant metapopulations in 16-km(2) squares were larger, had longer modeled persistence times (using IFM), and higher metapopulation capacity (lambda(M)) than six extinct metapopulations. However, there was a >99% chance that one or more of the six extant metapopulations would go extinct in 100 years in the absence of further habitat loss. For 11 out of 12 networks, minimum areas of habitat needed for 95% persistence of metapopulation simulations after 100 years ranged from 80 to 142 ha (similar to 5-9% of land area), depending on the spatial location of habitat. The area of habitat exceeded the estimated minimum viable metapopulation size (MVM) in only two of the six extant metapopulations, and even then by only 20%. The remaining four extant networks were expected to suffer extinction in 15-126 years. MVM was consistently estimated as similar to 5% of land area based on a sensitivity analysis of IFM parameters and was reduced only marginally (to similar to 4%) by modeling the potential impact of long-distance colonization over wider landscapes. The results suggest a widespread extinction debt among extant metapopulations of a declining species, necessitating conservation management or reserve designation even in apparent strongholds. For threatened species, metapopulation modeling is a potential means to identify landscapes near to extinction thresholds, to which conservation measures can be targeted for the best chance of success.",NA,NA,2007,"ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2007 JUL","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS",17,"5","1460","1473","10.1890/06-1032.1","1051-0761","WOS:000248265700016","1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Bulman, Caroline R. et al.

Contemporary extinction rates far surpass background rates [3], but they seem remarkably low in plants [4, 5]. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed, and as a result, extinction rates may vary among regions. Some authors have contentiously argued that novel anthropic habitats and human-induced plant speciation can actually increase regional biodiversity [6, 7]. Here, we report on one of the most comprehensive datasets to date, including regional and global plant extinctions in both biodiversity hotspots (mostly from Mediterranean-type climate regions) and coldspots (mostly from Eurasian countries). Our data come from regions covering 15.3% of the Earth's surface and span over 300 years. With this dataset, we explore the trends, causes, and temporal dynamics of recent plant extinctions. We found more, and faster accrual of, absolute numbers of extinction events in biodiversity hotspots compared to coldspots. Extinction rates were also substantially higher than historical background rates, but recent declines are evident. We found higher levels of taxonomic uniqueness being lost in biodiversity coldspots compared to hotspots. Causes of plant extinctions also showed distinct temporal patterns, with agriculture, invasions, and urbanization being significant drivers in hotspots, while hydrological disturbance was an important driver in coldspots.

Decreasing genetic diversity and changing population structure can reduce plant fitness and influence the long-term persistence of populations. Dry calcareous grasslands in Estonia have witnessed a large decline in area within the last 80 years, but due to extinction debt, the species richness in these grasslands has not yet responded to this decline. In these calcareous grasslands, we studied genetic diversity, phenotypic performance and population characteristics of a common habitat-specialist grass, Briza media. A decrease in genetic diversity was associated with a decrease in plant reproductive output. In addition, we found that some fitness components of B. media showed a delayed response to landscape changes. Specifically, plant height and germination success were related to historical rather than to current landscape parameters, indicating a time-lagged response of plant performance to habitat fragmentation.

We used quantitative data on long-distance seed dispersal potential by wind and grazing cattle (epi- and endozoochory), and on persistence (adult plant longevity and seed bank persistence) to quantify the linkages between dispersal and persistence traits in grassland plant communities and current and past landscape configurations. The long-distance dispersal potential of present-day communities was positively associated with the amounts of grassland in the historical (1835, 1938) landscape, and with a long continuity of grazing management-but was not associated with the properties of the current landscape. The study emphasises the role of history as a determinant of the dispersal potential of present-day grassland plant communities. The importance of long-distance dispersal processes has declined in the increasingly fragmented modern landscape, and long-term persistent species are expected to play a more dominant role in grassland communities in the future.

Identifying factors contributing to these inconsistencies is a vital step in clarifying the ecological importance of landscape features and synthesizing an effective knowledge base for use in conservation contexts. We examined the influence of several spatial, temporal, and life history assumptions on the outcomes of distribution versus landscape models (DLMs) relating wetland bird communities at 29 Massachusetts (USA) sites to independent urbanization, wetland, forest, and agricultural landscape gradients. We considered a bird specialization index as well as obligate and facultative species richness as response variables. Landscape gradients were quantified at 10 landscape extents (0-1000 m in 100 m increments) and three time periods (1971, 1985, 2005). Univariate models indicated that our specialization index showed: (1) the strongest response to landscape gradients at small extents (200 m); (2) a negative, threshold response to urbanization was superior to a linear fit; and (3) no evidence of time-lagged effects of landscape change. Interestingly, the form of our model (i.e. linear versus threshold) influenced the extent at which strongest effects were detected. Multivariate models relating the specialization index as well as obligate and facultative species richness to landscape gradients showed evidence of annual variability (i.e. composition, parameter estimates, and variability explained) that did not depend upon an organism's degree of specialization.

While many studies have tested the effects of landscape context on the species richness and composition of vascular plants, few have compared the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes on the same landscape. We sampled non-epiphytic bryophytes and vascular plants in 184 plots to test whether three landscape context factors measured four years or four decades previously could predict bryophyte or vascular plant species richness and composition after accounting for local factors. Location Temperate forests and oak savannahs, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Methods We used model selection and comparisons to test the effects of surrounding road density, total amount of forest, and distance to the nearest forest edge on species richness, species richness of non-disturbance-associated species, and community composition after controlling for important local predictors including substrate availability and topography. Results The species richness of non-disturbance-associated vascular plants was lower in plots with greater surrounding historical road density, and perennial stayer bryophyte richness declined with increasing historical road density and lower historical forest amount, suggesting a potential extinction debt. Landscape context significantly affected total species richness and community composition of vascular plants, but not bryophytes.

Land conversion generates extinction and functioning debts, i.e. a time-delayed loss of species and associated ecosystem services. Sustainability theory, however, has not so far considered the longterm consequences of these ecological debts on SESs. We investigate this question using a dynamical model that couples human demography, technological change and biodiversity. Human population growth drives land conversion, which in turn reduces biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services to agricultural production (ecological feedback). Technological change brings about a demographic transition leading to a population equilibrium. When the ecological feedback is delayed in time, some SESs experience population overshoots followed by large reductions in biodiversity, human population size and well-being, which we call environmental crises. Using a sustainability criterion that captures the vulnerability of an SES to such crises, we show that some of the characteristics common to modern SESs (e.g. high production efficiency and labor intensity, concave-down ecological relationships) are detrimental to their long-term sustainability. Maintaining sustainability thus requires strong counteracting forces, such as the demographic transition and land-use management. To this end, we provide integrative sustainability thresholds for land conversion, biodiversity loss and human population size - each threshold being related to the others through the economic, technological, demographic and ecological parameters of the SES. Numerical simulations show that remaining within these sustainable boundaries prevents environmental crises from occurring. By capturing the long-term ecological and socio-economic drivers of SESs, our theoretical approach proposes a new way to define integrative conservation objectives that ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet.

Their continued loss through deforestation and agriculture is the main threat to species globally, more than disease, invasive species, and climate change. However, not all tropical forests have the same ability to sustain biodiversity. Those that have been disturbed by humans, including forests previously cleared and regrown (secondary growth), have lower levels of species richness compared with undisturbed (primary) forests. The difference is even greater considering extinctions that will later emanate from the disturbance (extinction debt). Here, we find that Haiti has less than 1% of its original primary forest and is therefore among the most deforested countries. Primary forest has declined over three decades inside national parks, and 42 of the 50 highest and largest mountains have lost all primary forest. Our surveys of vertebrate diversity (especially amphibians and reptiles) on mountaintops indicates that endemic species have been lost along with the loss of forest. At the current rate, Haiti will lose essentially all of its primary forest during the next two decades and is already undergoing a mass extinction of its biodiversity because of deforestation. These findings point to the need, in general, for better reporting of forest cover data of relevance to biodiversity, instead of ""total forest"" as defined by the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization.

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location: Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts Time period: 30-0 thousand years before present (kybp) Major taxa studied: Vascular plants Methods: Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30-20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20-10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming), and 10-0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results: Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0 â°C x10-4 yr-1) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2 â°C x10-4 yr-1) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Conclusions: Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming. Consistent patterns from different midden series across the region support a metacommunity model in which dispersal interacts with environmental filters and buffers against local extinction to drive community-climate disequilibrium during and after periods of warming.

What the recovery debt really quantifies is the interim deviation rather than reduction of biodiversity and ecosystem functions from undisturbed state. These two are obviously very different things. The ambiguity seems to be reflected in the way the recovery debt values are constantly referred as 'reductions' or 'deficits' of biodiversity and functions.

In dynamic landscapes, most studies measure connectivity at multiple time steps, but pay less attention to explicitly quantifying its temporal dynamics to gain insights into its role in biodiversity patterns, thereby enabling more effective operational outcomes. Objectives This article aimed at making an overview of the existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity. By analysing their differences and possible applications, we aimed to highlight knowledge gap and future research directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature dealing with the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity and obtained 32 studies. Results We presented two main approaches based on graph theory and compared them from conceptual and operational perspectives. The first widely used approach, accounting only for the spatial dispersal of organisms, quantifies temporal changes in spatial connectivity. Based on two or multiple time steps in the time series, this approach enables assessment of the sense and magnitude of the temporal changes in spatial connectivity. The second recently developed approach quantifies spatio-temporal connectivity, thus accounting for both spatial and temporal dispersal. So far, this holistic assessment of spatio-temporal connectivity only covers two time steps.

Stream biodiversity may not respond to deforestation in a simple linear relationship. Rather, threshold responses to extent and timing of deforestation may occur. Identification of critical deforestation thresholds is needed for effective conservation and management. We tested for threshold responses of fish species and functional groups to degree of watershed and riparian zone deforestation and time since impact in 75 streams in the western Brazilian Amazon. We used remote sensing to assess deforestation from 1984 to 2011. Fish assemblages were sampled with seines and dip nets in a standardized manner. Fish species (n = 84) were classified into 20 functional groups based on ecomorphological traits associated with habitat use, feeding, and locomotion. Threshold responses were quantified using threshold indicator taxa analysis. Negative threshold responses to deforestation were common and consistently occurred at very low levels of deforestation (<20%) and soon after impact (<10 years). Sensitive species were functionally unique and associated with complex habitats and structures of allochthonous origin found in forested watersheds. Positive threshold responses of species were less common and generally occurred at >70% deforestation and >10 years after impact. Findings were similar at the community level for both taxonomic and functional analyses. Because most negative threshold responses occurred at low levels of deforestation and soon after impact, even minimal change is expected to negatively affect biodiversity. Delayed positive threshold responses to extreme deforestation by a few species do not offset the loss of sensitive taxa and likely contribute to biotic homogenization.",NA,NA,2018,"WILEY","2018 AUG","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY",32,"4","860","871","10.1111/cobi.13061","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000438200100012","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brejao, Gabriel L. et al.

The signs of past human forest use declined as a function of distance from villages. We found that the closest forests were 130 yr old or younger and contained very few elements typical of natural forests. Forests at a distance of between 1 and 1.5 km were older than 150 yr but showed marks of selective cuttings and had a less complete continuum of dead wood than forests that were 2-2.5 km from the villages. The most remote stands, which were generally older than 200 yr, predominantly had no signs of past forest use and had the most diverse dead wood composition.

"ref_200","JOUR",NA,"Hanski, I and Ovaskainen, O","Extinction debt at extinction threshold","To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II.

We investigated (1) whether species response to past land use (ancient versus recent forest) was consistent with species response to distance to present forest edge (core versus periphery) (2) what life-history traits explained plant response to distance to present edge and past land use (3) whether distance to past forest edge explained current species distribution better than distance to present forest edge.LocationTemperate forests in the northern half of France (80,000km(2)).MethodsLocal climate, soil and stand characteristics, past land use, and present and past landscape metrics were collected on 11,936 plots using National Forest Inventory data and historical maps from 1831. Logistic regressions were applied to determine the response patterns of 181 species to present and past landscape, while controlling for local habitat quality (soil, climate and stand).ResultsSpecies response to distance to present edge very well matched response to past land use. Plant traits related to colonization capacity explained species response to present edge and past land use. The spatial distribution of 42 species was better explained by distance to forest edge in 1831, 37 species were better explained by distance to present edge and 24 species were better explained by distance to present edge and past land use.Main conclusionsTwo mechanisms were responsible for the long-range periphery-to-core gradient: (1) past landscape and colonization processes and (2) present edge-related mechanisms. This suggests that plant community differences between periphery and core zones are thus related to dispersal limitation and not only to environmental filters.

We hypothesize that habitat loss has delayed effects on neutral immigration-extinction dynamics, while edge effects and environmental heterogeneity in habitat patches have rapid effects on niche-based dynamics. We analyzed taxonomic and functional composition of 100 tree communities in a tropical dry forest landscape of New-Caledonia subject to habitat loss and fragmentation. We designed an original, process-based simulation framework, and performed Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer the influence of niche-based and neutral processes. Then, we performed partial regressions to evaluate the relationships between inferred parameter values of communities and landscape metrics (distance to edge, patch area, and habitat amount around communities), derived from either recent or past (65 yrs ago) aerial photographs, while controlling for the effect of soil and topography. We found that landscape structure influences both environmental filtering and immigration. Immigration rate was positively related to past habitat amount surrounding communities. In contrast, environmental filtering was mostly affected by present landscape structure and mainly influenced by edge vicinity and topography. Our results highlight that landscape changes have contrasting spatio-temporal influences on niche-based and neutral assembly dynamics. First, landscape-level habitat loss and community isolation reduce immigration and increase demographic stochasticity, resulting in slow decline of local species diversity and extinction debt. Second, recent edge creation affects environmental filtering, incurring rapid changes in community composition by favoring species with edge-adapted strategies. Our study brings new insights about temporal impacts of landscape changes on biodiversity dynamics. We stress that landscape history critically influences these dynamics and should be taken into account in conservation policies. New Caledonia is an archipelago located in southwest Pacific (20-23Â° S, 164-167Â° E). The study area is a 20x20km landscape located in a plain surrounded by low-elevation mountains (500-1000m), on the west coast of the main island (Kone-Pouembout plain). It receives ~1000-1400 mmÂ·yr-1 rainfall and the mean annual temperature is ~23-24 Â°C (WorldClim2 database, Fick & Hijmans 2017). The vegetation is a mosaic of evergreen dry forest patches (tropical dry forest, Holdridge 1947) surrounded by secondary thickets and farmlands. We designed a random sampling scheme stratified by patch area. Based on a present landscape map, we selected 36 accessible patches spanning a wide range of area (0.5-272.2 ha, median 23.6). We excluded areas recently colonized by the forest (i.e., areas currently covered by forest, but which were open in 1954). Then, we applied a 25*25m square grid and, in each patch, we randomly selected a number of grid nodes proportionally to the logarithm of patch area.Within a circular 400m plot (i.e., 11.30m radius) at each selected point, we identified all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 meters above ground) above 10cm. We ensured that the entire plots were actually within forest patches by relocating the center of plots away from the edge if necessary. All the plots were established during years 2017 and 2018. For all sampled species, we measured five wood and leaf functional traits involved in resource-use strategies and stress resistance, following standardized protocols in Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). Trait were collected during years 2017 and 2018. For leaf traits, we collected five leaves per individual and sampled five individuals per species. For compound leaves, we considered a leaflet as the laminar unit. Petioles and petiolules were removed from leaves before measurement. We measured leaf area (the area of a leaf in cm), Specific Leaf Area (the leaf area per dry mass in cmÂ·g- 1), and Leaf Dry-Matter Content (the leaf dry mass per fresh mass in mgÂ·g- 1). Specific leaf area and leaf dry-matter content capture species investment in leaves, and represent a trade-off between acquisitive (high specific leaf area) and conservative (high leaf dry-matter content) strategies along the leaf economic spectrum (Wright et al. 2004). Leaf area represents the light-capturing and transpiration surface and is thus related to water-use efficiency (Moles 2018). We measured the wood density of one wood sample per individual and five individuals per species. Wood density is a key trait of the wood economic spectrum, from water use efficiency and high growth rate to lower growth rate and drought resistance (Chave et al. 2009). Furthermore, we measured bark thickness. Thick bark provides stem protection from heat and fire (Pausas 2015), as well as from other damages (Rosell 2016). For bark thickness, we calculated the mean of two bark measures on individual trees, and sampled at least 15 individuals per species (mean = 17.8). For wood density and bark thickness of 38 species, data were complemented from the New Caledonian plant inventory and permanent plot network (NC-PIPPN) database, in which trait measurements were carried out using identical protocols (Ibanez et al. 2017a). In subsequent analyses, we used the mean trait value per species for leaf traits and wood density. As bark thickness varies with DBH (Pausas 2015), we used the maximum value per species, to better approximate an upper bound reached during tree growth. We used a Box-Cox transformation (Box & Cox 1964) on each trait to get distributions closer to normality. The five functional traits were finally informed for 99 species, representing 90% of the identified species (n = 110), and more than 99% of the identified individuals (n = 3069). We used this subset of 99 species in further analyses. We evaluated trait covariation to identify main functional dimensions (trait spectra) across species by performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of species traits values, with varimax orthogonal rotation of the three first components. Trait values were centered and scaled to unit variance before performing PCA. We considered species scores on the first three rotated PCA (RPCA) axes as synthetic trait values representing species ecological strategies along the main functional dimensions. The synthetic trait values where standardized between 0 and 1. Wequantified summary statistics representing (i) taxonomic composition, i.e., species richness (S, the number of species) and Shannon diversity (ES), and (ii) functional composition, i.e., community weighted mean (CWM) and community weighted variance (CWV) of eachtrait and each synthetic trait (RPCA axes).

For communities of microorganisms, the question remains if and how they answer to landscape structure, with or without time lag, and if some groups of microorganisms may react more than others. Here, we investigated if fungi or bacteria diversity is driven by the amount of forest cover in the current or the past landscape. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis (HAH) on ancient forests of Cevennes national park, that were particularly fragmented 150 years ago, and are today surrounded by recent forests. As ancient forests are often more diverse in plant species, we hypothesized that the higher quantity of ancient forests in the landscape, the richer fungal and bacterial communities would be locally. More precisely, we expected that ectomycorrhizal fungi, and pathotrophic fungi, often indicators of mature forests, would be also more sensitive to forest history and therefore to the quantity of ancient forests than bacteria and saprotrophic fungi. We sampled 40 soil cores per 0.5 ha, pooled in 8 composite samples per plot in 27 landscapes and sequenced ITS and 16S marker by Illumina-Mi seq. To identify functional groups of fungi, we relied on their taxonomy and the use of public databases. Our results partly follow the HAH, as fungi richness was positively related with the quantity of ancient forests in the landscape and not by the focal patch size. Ectomycorrhizal and pathotrophic fungi were positively affected by the ancient forest cover, and so were saprotrophic ones, but not bacteria. Local factors also shaped the communities such as soil composition and elevation, confirming classical patterns in soil ecology. Interestingly, past landscape structure better explained fungi communities richness than contemporary landscape, suggesting a time lag in the response of communities to landscape modification and a potential extinction debt. Our results invite to consider below-ground communities in landscape studies and historical ecology, as their structure and functions might be intimately linked with soil and landscape history. Soil samples were collected on April 2017 (average temperature 4.4 Â°C, average precipitation 17.6 mm from www infoclimat.fr). In each study site, soil cores were collected along two 60 m transect, spaced from 20 m : every 20 m a soil core was collected, and pooled with four soil cores collected at 3.5 m from the focal point in each cardinal direction. As a result, 40 soil cores pooled in 8 composite samples were collected per plot. The composite samples were then opened back to the lab the same day, and 15 g of soil was isolated in a clean tea-bag and dried with 50 g of silicagel (eventually more if the sample was not dry the day after). Soil DNA was extracted less than one month later with Macherey NagelNucleoSpin Soilkit (Ref740780.250). Amplifications targeted ITS1 nuclear rDNA primers for fungi (Fwd: ITS5 GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG from Epp et al. 2012 and a modified version of Rev: 5.8S_Fungi CAAGAGATCCGTTGTTGAAAGTK, Taberlet et al. 2018), and 16S rDNA (V5-V6) for bacteria (Bact01 primers - Fwd: GGATTAGATACCCTGGTAGT and Rev: CACGACACGAGCTGACG (Fliegerova et al. 2014)). Each PCR was performed with a unique set of primers, characterized by a unique set of 8 nucleotide tags added to the universal primers, allowing to distinguish samples later in the analysis (as described in Taberlet et al. 2018). Negative controls without any PCR reactants were integrated (10% of our reactions) and all PCR reactions were replicated twice. PCR conditions followed Nagati et al. (2018). All PCR reactions were pooled to prepare Illumina-Miseq libraries, which were sent to GenoToul Core Facility platform for sequencing.

Here, it is argued that warming-induced species losses will generally exceed gains and there will be more net declines than net increases in plant community richness. Declines in richness are especially likely in water-limited climates where intensifying aridity will increasingly exceed plant tolerances, but also in colder temperature-limited climates where steep climatic gradients are lacking, and therefore, large pools of appropriate species are not immediately adjacent. The selectivity of warming-induced losses may lead to declines in functional and phylogenetic diversity as well as in species richness, especially in water-limited climates. Our current understanding of climate-caused diversity trends may be overly influenced by numerous studies coming from north-temperate alpine mountaintops, where conditions are unusually favourable for increases-possibly temporary-in local species richness.

Theory and empirical studies suggest that landscape structure influences species diversity in many habitats.

A similar, but often neglected, scaling issue concerns the temporal scale of species response to landscape change. In this study, we found time lags of 50-100 years in the response of plant species diversity to changing configuration of habitats in the landscape. When analyzing remnants of traditionally managed seminatural grasslands in Sweden, we found that species diversity was not related to present-day connectivity of the investigated sites, irrespective of spatial scale (3.1-12.5 km(2)). However, when using maps depicting landscapes 50 and 100 years ago, respectively, strong positive effects of habitat connectivity appeared, at increasing spatial scale for the older landscapes.

An accurate depiction of the state of biodiversity on our planet, combined with identifying the mechanisms driving local biodiversity change, underpins our ability to predict how different societal priorities and actions will influence biodiversity trajectories. Quantitative syntheses provide a fundamental tool by taking information from multiple sources to identify generalisable patterns. However, syntheses, by definition, combine data sources that have fundamentally different purposes, contexts, designs and sources of error and bias; they may thus provide contradictory results, not because of the biological phenomena of interest, but due instead to combining diverse data.

The increase in invasion levels might not be immediate but rather exhibit a time-lag (i.e. invasion debt). Moreover, the relationship between invasion and landscape history (i.e. changes in landscape composition) might be extremely complex as it might also include extinction debts of invasive species currently in regression. In order to understand the effect of landscape history on plant invasion, we studied the invasion level in coastal plant communities affected by intense human-driven landscape alteration in the last 50 years. We identified all non-native plant species within 809 grid cells (250 x 250 m) along similar to 500 km of the Spanish SW coast. We tested the association of (1) non-native richness conditional on the overall presence of non-natives (at least one species), and (2) the occurrence of the most frequent non-native species, with the percentage of human land-cover categories in 1956, 1991 and 2007 using a multimodel inference approach. We used these models to project future invasion patterns in the region. We found non-native richness to be more associated with land-cover variables in 1956 than in 2007, suggesting the existence of an invasion debt, but not for the overall presence of non-natives. For most frequent species, the effects of past landscape alteration depended on the introduction pathway and the region of origin. Species used in agriculture were more related to past cropland area, while most of the species used in gardening or forestry showed higher affinity for recently altered areas. These results highlight the relevance of the species' introduction history and landscape history in assessing future long-term invasion trends.",NA,NA,2017,"SPRINGER","2017 FEB","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS",19,"2","549","561","10.1007/s10530-016-1314-z","1387-3547 and 1573-1464","WOS:000394152300009","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Gonzalez-Moreno, Pablo et al.

We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points.

Their restoration supports arthropod biodiversity within farming systems. We investigated limiting factors for arthropod establishment during grassland restoration across a chronosequence of 52 restoration sites established by either natural regenerating or direct seeding. Our study covered 363 arthropod species of 10 orders, including detritivores, herbivores, predators and pollinators. These were sampled using pitfall traps, suction sampling and transect walks. The similarity of plant communities on restoration sites to target species rich grasslands was positively correlated with the similarity of the arthropod communities to these same grasslands. There was evidence that restoration sites located in landscapes suffering from historic large-scale loss of species rich grassland (1930-2015) had lower success in replicating the composition of arthropod communities and supported the lowest levels of species richness. The age of the restoration site was a predictor of restoration success for some trophic levels. For example, predator species richness was greatest in the oldest restoration sites. However, this was only the case were sites were either of large size or located in landscapes with the lowest historic loss of species rich grassland. Impacts of within site management also affected arthropod communities. The annual frequency of cutting negatively affected detritivores species richness, and selected against traits including herbivore monophagy. Overall arthropod species richness was positively correlated with sward height. These results emphasise the relative importance of the success with which the floral community is replicated, as well as landscape and management factors, during grassland restoration. This has implications for future agri-environmental schemes.

"ref_210","DATA",NA,"Semper-Pascual, Asuncion","Data from: How do habitat amount and habitat fragmentation drive time-delayed responses of biodiversity to land-use change?","Land-use change is a root cause of the extinction crisis, but links between habitat change and biodiversity loss are not fully understood. While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time-delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss vs. fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi- species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985-2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss vs. fragmentation studies. Biodiversity data: Birds were recorded at 233 sites during three field surveys between 2009 and 2014, with a mean distance of 4.7-km between sites (standard deviation: SD=6.5-km). We conducted point counts at each site (two to nine point counts per site). Here, we only considered species that use woodland as their main habitat, as this is by far the dominant natural vegetation in the area and we wanted to test for time-delayed responses to woodland loss and fragmentation. We discarded migrant species to avoid seasonal effects and species associated with the Andean Cloud forest (i.e., Yungas) that were only recorded in the Chaco-Yungas ecotone. Mammals were surveyed during two field surveys between 2013 and 2016, using a total of 198 camera-trap stations. The mean distance between adjacent sites was 1.44-km (SD=1.74). We set cameras off trail where possible, to reduce detection bias associated with targeted sampling. Cameras were active between 14 and 84 trapping days (mean=39.8 days), with a total sampling effort of 7,883 trapping days. We only considered woodland-dependent mammal species. Landscape predictors: We calculated landscape-scale metrics of habitat amount and fragmentation, meaning that they described the spatial characteristics of entire landscapes, not individual patches. We extracted predictors for circular landscapes centered around each sampling site. Based on sensitivity analyses, we used a 4-km radius for birds, and a 2-km radius for mammals.We calculated one landscape predictor representing habitat amount: percentage of woodland. To characterize fragmentation, we calculated three predictors: percentage of edge, patch density and cohesion index. To define the contemporary landscape predictors, we related each site to the landscape predictors of the year when biodiversity was sampled (e.g., sites sampled in 2015 were related to the predictors from 2015). We then derived a time series of past landscape predictors 24 years back in time (i.e., landscape patterns from 1 year prior to sampling, 2 years prior to sampling, etc.). We used a maximum time period of 24 years because this is the time span between the oldest Landsat-based woodland map (1985) and the oldest biodiversity sampling (2009) in our dataset.

We studied the colonization-extinction dynamics of eight wood-decaying fungal species in 16 old-growth forest fragments (<14 ha) over a 20-year period (1997-2017). We observed 19 extinctions and 5 colonizations; yet, the distribution of extinctions and colonizations did not differ from the one expected by chance for any of the species. Twenty-six percent of the extinctions took place in two natural fragments amid large forest-peatland complexes. Phellinus nigrolimitatus (Romell) Bourdot and Galzin decreased and Phellinus ferrugineofuscus (P. Karst.) Bourdot increased in abundance (number of logs occupied). The volume of living spruce trees in the forest fragments correlated positively with the number of logs inhabited in five of the study species. Because fragment characteristics did not affect species turnover, it seems that stochastic processes governed colonizations and extinctions.

Methods We mapped past and present land use for 36 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden, to estimate connectivity based on simple habitat spatial configuration (structural connectivity) and accounting for effective dispersal and establishment (functional connectivity) around focal grasslands. We used the resulting measures of landscape change to interpret patterns in plant communities. Results Increased presence of landscape connecting elements could not compensate for large scale losses of grassland area resulting in substantial declines in structural and functional connectivity. Generalist species were negatively affected by connectivity, and responded most strongly to structural connectivity, while functional connectivity determined the occurrence of grassland specialists in focal grasslands. Restored patches had more generalist species, and a lower density of grassland specialist species than ancient patches. Conclusions Protecting both species rich grasslands and dispersal pathways within landscapes is essential for maintaining grassland biodiversity. Our results show that increases in green infrastructure have not been sufficient to offset loss of semi-natural habitat, and that landscape links must be functionally effective in order to contribute to grassland diversity.",NA,NA,2021,"SPRINGER","2021 JAN","LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY",36,"1","265","280","10.1007/s10980-020-01138-x","0921-2973 and 1572-9761","WOS:000581573700001","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Kimberley, Adam et al.

However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000-5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000-8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.",NA,NA,2019,"WILEY","2019 OCT","ECOLOGY",100,"10",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecy.2817","0012-9658 and 1939-9170","WOS:000482324900001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Butterfield, Bradley J. et al.

The magnitude of the ecological impacts of habitat loss can be exacerbated by the spatial arrangement - or fragmentation - of remaining habitat. Fragmentation per se is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modified environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries. The implications of this for individual organisms are many and varied, because species with differing life history strategies are differentially affects by habitat fragmentation. Here, we review the extensive literature on species responses to habitat fragmentation, and detail the numerous ways in which confounding factors have either masked the detection, or prevented the manifestation, of predicted fragmentation effects.Large numbers of empirical studies continue to document changes in species richness with decreasing habitat area, wit positive, negative and no relationships regularly reported. The debate surrounding such widely contrasting results is beginning to be resolved by findings that the expected positive species-area relationship can be masked by matrix-derived spatial subsides of resources to fragment-swelling species and by invasion of matrix-dwelling species into habitat edges. Significant advances have been made recently in our understanding of how species interactions are altered at habitat edges as a result of these changes. Interestingly, changes in biotic and abiotic parameters at edges also make ecological processes more variable than in habitat interiors. Individuals are more likely to encounter habitat edges in fragments wit convoluted shapes, leading to increased turnover and variability in population size that in fragments that are compact in shape. Habitat isolation in both space and time disrupts species distribution patterns, with consequent effects on metapopulation dynamics and the genetic structure of fragment-dwelling populations. Again, the matrix habitat is a strong determinant of fragmentation effects within remnants because of its role in regulating dispersal and dispersal-related mortality, the provision of spatial subsides and the potential mediation of edge-related microclimatic gradients.We show that confounding factors can mask many fragmentation effects. For instance, there are multiple ways in which species traits like trophic level, dispersal ability and degree of habitat specialisation influence species-level responses. The temporal scale of investigation may have a Strong influence Oil the results Ora study, with short-term crowding effects eventually giving way to long-term extinction debts. Moreover. many fragmentation effects like changes in genetic, morphological or behavioural traits Of Species require time to appear. By contrast, synergistic interactions of fragmentation with climate change, human-altered disturbance regimes, species interactions and other drivers of population decline may magnify the impacts of fragmentation. To conclude, we emphasise that anthropogenic fragmentation is a recent phenomenon in evolutionary time and suggest that the final, long-term impacts of habitat fragmentation may not yet have shown themselves.",NA,NA,2006,"WILEY","2006 FEB","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS",81,"1","117","142","10.1017/S1464793105006949","1464-7931 and 1469-185X","WOS:000236101600005","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Ewers, RM et al.

However, the suitability of novel restoration concepts such as trophic rewilding is still under discussion given fragmentary empirical data and limited theory development. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates the concept of 'ecological memory' into trophic rewilding. The ecological memory of an ecosystem is defined as an ecosystem's accumulated abiotic and biotic material and information legacies from past dynamics. By summarising existing knowledge about the ecological effects of megafauna extinction and rewilding across a large range of spatial and temporal scales, we identify two key drivers of ecosystem responses to trophic rewilding: (i) impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna, and (ii) ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem. The impact potential of (re)introduced megafauna species can be estimated from species properties such as lifetime per capita engineering capacity, population density, home range size and niche overlap with resident species. The importance of ecological memory characterising the focal ecosystem depends on (i) the absolute time since megafauna loss, (ii) the speed of abiotic and biotic turnover, (iii) the strength of species interactions characterising the focal ecosystem, and (iv) the compensatory capacity of surrounding source ecosystems. These properties related to the focal and surrounding ecosystems mediate material and information legacies (its ecological memory) and modulate the net ecosystem impact of (re)introduced megafauna species. We provide practical advice about how to quantify all these properties while highlighting the strong link between ecological memory and historically contingent ecosystem trajectories. With this newly established ecological memory-rewilding framework, we hope to guide future empirical studies that investigate the ecological effects of trophic rewilding and other ecosystem-restoration approaches. The proposed integrated conceptual framework should also assist managers and decision makers to anticipate the possible trajectories of ecosystem dynamics after restoration actions and to weigh plausible alternatives. This will help practitioners to develop adaptive management strategies for trophic rewilding that could facilitate sustainable management of functioning ecosystems in an increasingly human-dominated world.",NA,NA,2019,"WILEY","2019 FEB","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS",94,"1","1","15","10.1111/brv.12432","1464-7931 and 1469-185X","WOS:000456071400001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Schweiger, Andreas H. et al.

We observed an overall increase in estimated epiphyll abundances and species richness in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha reserves) suggesting recovery rather than a belated accumulation of local extinction events. However, higher turnover in smaller fragments, when compared to large ones, was driven by increased presence of core species indicating interspecific differences in survivability. These disproportionate changes in occupancy patterns and relative abundances in fragments were best explained by life history traits reflecting increased dispersal capacity and physiological tolerances suggesting recovery of the phyllosphere community in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha) over 15 years. Even for this group renowned for fast generation times and high reproductive output, epiphyll metacommunities of smaller fragments have yet to recover from local extinctions accrued following the initial fragmentation nearly 40 years ago.

(2) Time lags between land-use change and ecosystem responses delay effects on ES supply, illustrated for biodiversity-based services that may experience an ES debt. (3) Threshold relationships exist, such that changes in ES are difficult to reverse, and legacy lock-in disconnects contemporary landscapes from ES supply, illustrated by hydrologic services. Mismatches between contemporary landscape patterns and mechanisms underpinning ES supply yield unexpected patterns of ES.Today's land-use decisions will generate tomorrow's legacies, and ES will be affected if processes underpinning ES are affected by land-use legacies.

Measuring the balance of species loss and gain in remaining fragmented landscapes throughout time entails a central research challenge. We resurveyed in 2013 plant species richness in the same plots of a previous sampling conducted in 2003 across 18 forest fragments of different sizes of the Chaco Serrano forest in Argentina. While the area of these forest remnants was kept constant, their surrounding forest cover changed over this time period. We compared plant species richness of both sampling years and calculated the proportion of species loss and gain at forest edges and interiors. As in 2003, we found a positive relationship between fragment area and plant richness in 2013 and both years showed a similar slope. However, we detected a net decrease of 24% of species' richness across all forest fragments, implying an unprecedentedly high rate and magnitude of species loss driven mainly by non-woody, short-lived species. There was a higher proportion of lost and gained species at forest edges than in forest interiors. Importantly, fragment area interacted with percent change in surrounding forest cover to explain the proportion of species lost. Small forest fragments showed a relatively constant proportion of species loss regardless of any changes in surrounding forest cover, whereas in larger fragments the proportion of species lost increased when surrounding forest cover decreased. We show that despite preserving fragment area, habitat quality and availability in the surroundings is of fundamental importance in shaping extinction and immigration dynamics of plant species at any given forest remnant. Because the Chaco Serrano forest has already lost 94% of its original cover, we argue that plant extinctions will continue through the coming decades unless active management actions are taken to increase native forest areas.",NA,NA,2018,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2018 NOV 28","PLOS ONE",13,"11",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0206738","1932-6203","WOS:000451755800029","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Aguilar, Ramiro et al.

However, quantifying the effect of these pressures is difficult due to the time-lagged responses of biodiversity to landscape change. The aim of this study is to determine if genetic diversity of plant populations exhibits a delayed response to recent landscape change. Using microsatellite markers, we evaluated genetic diversity in 28 populations of a grassland plant Trifolium montanum in Estonian calcareous grasslands. We examined the response of genetic diversity to various current and historic landscape parameters assessed at two time points: (1) 2017, and (2) 1930, when the extent of grasslands in Estonia was at its maximum. Observed heterozygosity (H-O) and inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) were affected by historic grassland availability in the surroundings of the study populations (buffer radius of 2000 m). However, expected heterozygosity (H-E) responded positively to current grassland area and to the availability of grasslands in the surrounding landscape. Allelic richness (A(R)) was positively related to current population size. We found evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks in half of the study populations, indicating that landscape change had a negative impact on population demography and consequent genetic diversity. Our findings suggest that regardless of major habitat loss, some measures of genetic diversity of perennial plant species may not be at equilibrium with landscape change.

Grassland plant diversity has declined due to abandonment, changed management methods and production intensification. Current diversity patterns are thus a result of historical and current land use in combination. In this study we investigate the relative importance of historical grassland management and current land use for grassland plant diversity. The distribution of 128 grassland plant species in an agricultural landscape in southwest Sweden was analysed in relation to current land use and land use in three historical time periods; the 18th and the 19th century and around 1960. Land use during the three historical periods was also combined into land-use sequences. Four diversity estimates were used: number of grassland species, number of grassland specialists, Shannon-Wiener index on the specialists and total cover/hectare of specialists. Historical land use - especially 18th century and the land-use sequences - explained more of the variation among study sites than did current land use. Continuity of a specific management type was important for grassland plants as indicated by highest diversities being found in pastures continuously grazed since the 18th century. Former hay meadows, currently grazed, did not differ in any diversity estimate from abandoned hay meadows, indicating that change of management from mowing to grazing a century ago may cause diversity declines similar to abandonment some 40 years ago. Limited artificial fertilisation in the managed areas may have contributed to this effect. Further decline in grassland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape is expected because a substantial proportion of grassland plant populations occur in abandoned areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The highest species richness was observed on larger and more heterogeneous localities with rocks and shallow soils, which were already large and well connected to other localities in 1938. The changes in the landscape structure in the past can thus have strong effects on current species richness.

Usually, they are scattered patches in surrounding forests. The spontaneous expansion of trees and shrubs, favored by the recent decline of mountain agriculture, lead the maggengo patches patterns and shapes to change. Our objective was to analyze the effect of this change on current plant diversity of the remnant patches, as the adaptive response could be slow and possibly related more to historical than to current landscape patterns. We analyzed the trend of the size, shape, elongation, fractal dimension and connectivity of maggengo patches of a Central-Eastern Italian Alpine district, in four time steps, from 1973 to 2006, and in 1859, when mountain agriculture was still widespread. Then, we studied the relationships between those landscape metrics and two current patch-level plant diversity measures: interior species richness and species density. Aerial photographs were used to investigate that trend, while a historical cadastral map was used to assess the landscape metrics in 1859. As expected, in the last 30 years, the total size of maggenghi has been reduced by 57% while their shapes have been progressively simplified. Interior species richness was positively related to size, both in 2006 and over the past 30 years, but not to any 1859 measures. Conversely, species density was positively correlated only with 1859 size, shape index and connectivity.

However, several processes are known to generate deviations between spatial and temporal responses, potentially undermining the prediction based on space-for-time substitution. We here used high-resolution data from the french breeding bird survey to quantify and map the deviation between spatial and temporal patterns of bird abundances resulting from the dynamics of 124 species monitored in 2133 sites between 2001 and 2012. Using independent empirical data, we then tested specific predictions linked to the determinants (anthropogenic activities) and processes (lagged responses to environmental changes) potentially generating these deviations. We found that deviations between spatial and temporal patterns of abundances were particularly structured in space for bird communities. Following our predictions, these space-time deviations were positively correlated with the human influence on ecosystems, and linked with colonization-extinction ratios and community completeness, two markers of ongoing delayed responses to environmental changes. Our results suggest that the deviations between spatial and temporal patterns are related to recent anthropogenic environmental changes and disequilibrium responses to these changes.

A period of 150 years is too short for Succisa to have spread extensively if dispersal parameters are given realistic values.4 Simulations in which present-day land-use patterns were imposed at earlier dates showed that changes in landscape structure over the past 175 years also had a strong effect on the present-day habitat occupancy and population sizes of Succisa.5 The dominant process for Succisa now is extinction from marginal habitats. It is therefore likely that the (relatively) high present-day occupation patterns are still due to much larger areas having been available in the past rather than to successful dispersal. Although the species has responded to landscape changes, there is little evidence of population sizes reaching equilibrium.6 Our approach shows that the wealth of landscape information available from historical maps can be linked with data on population biology by means of dynamical models that can make predictions about species dynamics.",NA,NA,2006,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","2006 JAN","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",94,"1","131","143","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01063.x","0022-0477","WOS:000234028800013","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Herben, T et al.

Here we use a combination of alternative, qualitative approaches (expert opinion, historical records and temporal replication of surveys) to standardised monitoring and mapping programs to investigate the extent of change of a peri-urban butterfly assemblage. This assemblage, comprising 52 species, of which 46 are residents or seasonal immigrants, was studied at three spatial scales (local similar to 0.01 km(2), intermediate similar to 9 km(2) and regional similar to 100 km(2)) in the Eltham district near Melbourne based on presence/absence data over the past 40 (1981-2020) and 80 years (1941-2020). We then consider the causal factors or drivers that have led to changes, and we explore the timing and ecological patterns underpinning extirpations. Long-term records reveal substantial changes (mostly decline) in composition and species richness of the 46 breeding species at all spatial scales and time frames analysed. Although the magnitude and rate of decline were higher at the smaller, local to intermediate scales (29-43% decline over 40 years, loss rate of 0.20-0.25 species/year) compared with the larger, regional scale (26% decline over 80 years, loss rate of 0.15 species/year), extirpations at the larger scale were more alarming because they are indicative of widespread population collapse. Declines in relative abundance and occupancy were also recorded at the intermediate and regional spatial scales. Further decline (extinction debt) is anticipated for several ecological specialists currently known from very few sites. Historical extirpations mostly involved obligate myrmecophilous lycaenids and appear to have been largely driven by an interaction of urbanisation (habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation) and vegetation encroachment. More recent extirpations consist mainly of grass-feeding and mistletoe-feeding specialists and are more worrying because they have predominantly occurred within the past 20-30 years. An interaction of urbanisation (tree canopy death and decline of mistletoes and their host trees from ecosystem dysfunction) and climate change (water stress and heat waves) are considered to be the most likely drivers for these ecological guilds.",NA,NA,2021,"WILEY","2021 FEB","AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY",60,"1","27","51","10.1111/aen.12514","2052-1758 and 2052-174X","WOS:000607519700001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Braby, Michael F. et al.

Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed biomass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more.Context To cope with global warming, the majority of plants have either to migrate polewards or risk extinction. This is why conservationists value predictive models that can flag plant species that may not keep pace with global warming.Aims To identify which plant traits best explain migration potential in woody species by reanalysing a dataset of tree distribution ranges in Europe.Methods We used two statistical approaches to quantify migration lag. A direct approach compared frequency of large trees in the two latitudinal extremes and a modelling approach in which we first corrected data for the influence of temperature and then assessed the influence of latitude over the entire distribution of the tree species.Results Contrary to our intuition that tree longevity would best explain the ability of trees to migrate, we found that seed mass was the only good descriptor of migration potential: trees with heavier seeds lag more.Conclusion We interpret our results in terms of the well-established trade-off between seed mass and seed production in spermatophytes and discuss the possible functional implications that will result from selectively losing large-seeded trees.

Here, we compared species (SD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) (alpha) diversity among 272 dry grassland patches of two age-classes: old and new, with the new patches being dry grasslands established on previous intensively managed fields during the last 30 years. We first compared SD, FD and PD, between patches of different age. Then, we performed generalized linear models to determine the influence of abiotic, present-day and historical landscape configuration variables on SD, FD and PD. By measuring abiotic variables, we explained the effect of environmental filtering on species diversity, whereas the present-day and historical landscape configuration variables were included to describe how the spatial and temporal configuration of the patches influence patterns of species. Finally, we applied partial regressions to explore the relative importance of abiotic, present-day and historical variables in explaining the diversity metrics and how this varies between patches of different ages. We found higher SD in the old compared to the new patches, but no changes in FD and PD. SD was mostly affected by abiotic and present-day landscape configuration variables in the new and the old patches, respectively. In the new patches, historical variables explained variation in the FD, while present-day variables explained the PD. In the old patches, historical variables accounted for most of the variation in both FD and PD. Our evidence suggests that the relative importance of assembly processes has changed over time, showing that environmental filtering and changes in the landscape configuration prevented the establishment of species in the new patches.

How spatial configuration of patches in fragmented habitats influences biodiversity remains largely controversial. Here, we propose a framework to extend the species-area relationship (SAR) approach to analyze how changes in habitat configuration affect species richness in fragmented habitats. We use hypothetical communities that are characterized by (1) their tolerance to human activities, (2) the dispersal capability of the individuals of any species, (3) the SAR, and (4) the species turnover among patches. Further, the species turnover is a function of (4a) the predictability of species survival and (4b) the species recolonization odds. In our framework, we identify three extreme communities that encompass the richness of all potential different communities, and thus encapsulate the richness of real communities. We propose a graph to visualize the effect of different patch sizes on species richness, an index to quantify those changes, and a second graph using the index to visualize the effect of distance between patches on species richness. After applying our framework and tools to the Tropical Andes, we found strong differences in the impact of natural vs. human-driven fragmentation on richness between biomes. When projecting future richness values under climate change scenarios, the largest sources of uncertainty in our richness calculation (>90%) were species turnover among patches and species dispersal for most of the biomes rather than future climate or species tolerance to human activities. Habitat loss consistently decreased the species richness; however, fragmentation per se often increased it. The increment was mostly linked to the species turnover rate among patches. Our framework is a new theoretical tool to study the main patterns that underlie regional richness and therefore can provide new insights to face spatial habitat reconfiguration caused by human activities.",NA,NA,2017,"WILEY","2017 NOV","ECOSPHERE",8,"11",NA,NA,"10.1002/ecs2.2004","2150-8925","WOS:000417330000016","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Arnillas, Carlos Alberto et al.

In historically fragmented forests, however, species have evolved under fragmented conditions and might be more resistant to matrix modification. We examined the effect of contemporary matrix modification on forest regeneration potential in historically fragmented scarp-forest fragments in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We compared tree, seedling and sapling richness, abundance and composition in four forest-fragment types varying in size and matrix modification: large and small forest fragments surrounded by indigenous grassland and small forest fragments enclosed by eucalypt and sugarcane plantations. Additionally, seedlings and saplings were classified according to their origin as local/immigrant to assess matrix permeability for seed dispersers. Trees and saplings were slightly, and seedlings were strongly affected by matrix modification: seedling richness and abundance were significantly lower in fragments with sugarcane compared to fragments with grassland matrix. Furthermore, all stage classes revealed compositional differences with more light-tolerant species occurring in fragments with modified matrices. We suggest that human activities associated with matrix modification have altered abiotic factors favouring light-tolerant species. Changes in biotic interactions seemed to be less important as immigrant recruitment occurred in all fragments implying matrix permeability. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary matrix modification might threaten forest regeneration potential in historical scarp-forest fragments. Reduced seedling recruitment might indicate a time lag in local species extinction, as trees regenerate slowly. We recommend using both recruitment stages as early warning indicators.

However, forecasts from statistical models (e.g. species distribution models) rarely consider that plant community changes could substantially lag behind climatic changes, hindering our ability to make temporally realistic projections for the coming century. Indeed, the magnitudes of lags, and the relative importance of the different factors giving rise to them, remain poorly understood. We review evidence for three types of lag: ""dispersal lags"" affecting plant species' spread along elevational gradients, ""establishment lags"" following their arrival in recipient communities, and ""extinction lags"" of resident species. Variation in lags is explained by variation among species in physiological and demographic responses, by effects of altered biotic interactions, and by aspects of the physical environment. Of these, altered biotic interactions could contribute substantially to establishment and extinction lags, yet impacts of biotic interactions on range dynamics are poorly understood. We develop a mechanistic community model to illustrate how species turnover in future communities might lag behind simple expectations based on species' range shifts with unlimited dispersal. The model shows a combined contribution of altered biotic interactions and dispersal lags to plant community turnover along an elevational gradient following climate warming.

Different functional groups may have specific roles within the ecosystem processes and costly conservation efforts should be targeted at species of conservation concern. Therefore, an analysis of how functional or ecological groups recover following disturbance could provide more precise information than the recovery of taxonomic groups alone. We studied the recovery rate of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi in a boreal landscape where forest use had ceased more than 60 years ago. The forests in our study areas had a variable utilization history. The stands located near abandoned settlements were former scrubland. The adjacent stands formed a selectively cut zone and were followed by stands deeper in the forest matrix that were largely in pristine condition. We recorded boletoid, agaricoid and aphyllophoroid fungi species numbers in 0.25 ha sample plots at 500 m intervals along seven 2-2.5 km long transects. The transects started at the edge of the forest next to the abandoned settlements. Distance (intensity of previous forest utilization) did not affect the species richness of the taxonomic or functional groups of fungi, although the number of aphyllophoroid species of conservation concern was 50% lower in the forests that had been utilized in the past than in the surrounding pristine forests. Moreover, in stands close to the villages, the composition of aphyllophoroid species (beta diversity) differed from that of more distant and less utilized stands. Our results would suggest that the majority of ecosystem properties provided by higher fungi groups seem to recover within one century.

In this study, the effects of present and past landscape structures on carabid and spider communities were investigated. We hypothesized that present landscape structure was more highly correlated to small, omnivorous or macropterous carabids and small or ground-hunting spiders, while past landscape structure was more highly correlated to large or predatory carabids and large spiders.

However, several processes can lead to a same pattern. Focusing on observed, short-term patterns limits our ability to make inferences about ecological processes and responses to environmental change over time. In this study, we assessed changes in occupancy of two primate species in southeastern Brazil, following a major habitat loss due to implementation of a hydroelectric dam. Occupancy was assessed before dam construction and 11 years after, while explicitly accounting for imperfect detection. We assessed the effect of forest patch size and isolation on occupancy and rates of extinction and colonization, driven by landscape modification. Then we calculated occupancy under metapopulation equilibrium and expected time-lags resulting from non-equilibrium. We compared two primate species inhabiting forest patches, the black penciled marmoset Callithrix penicilatta and the black-fronted titi monkey Calliceb us nigrifrons, with markedly different ecological characteristics. Those differences may explain why occupancy dynamics were driven by distinct elements. A fast response to habitat changes was observed only for marmoset, an opportunistic species. However, non-equilibrium states and the possibility of time-lag effects were observed for titi monkey, a species dependent on forest habitat. Our analyses support the need to establish long term monitoring and assess system vital rates overtime.

Recently, in Japan, due to an economic recession, some previously developed lands have become vacant. Little is known, however, about the legacy of earlier earthmoving, which involves topsoil removal and ground leveling before residential construction, on plant community composition in such vacant lots. To understand (dis)assembly processes in vacant lots, we studied 24 grasslands in a suburban region in Japan: 12 grasslands that had experienced earthmoving and 12 that had not. We surveyed plant community composition and species richness, and clarified compositional turnover (replacement of species) and nestedness (nonrandom species loss) by distance-based beta-diversities, which were summarized by PCoA analysis. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to examine the effects of soil properties, mowing frequency, past and present habitat connectivities on compositional changes. As a result, past earthmoving, mowing frequency, soil properties, and past habitat connectivity were found to be the drivers of compositional turnover. In particular, we found legacy effects of earthmoving: earthmoving promoted turnover from native grassland species to weeds in arable lands or roadside by altering soil properties. Mowing frequency also promoted the same turnover, implying that extensive rather than intensive mowing can modify the negative legacy effects and maintain grassland species. Decrease in present habitat connectivity marginally enhanced nonrandom loss of native grassland species (nestedness). Present habitat connectivity had a positive effect on species richness, highlighting the important roles of contemporary dispersal. Our study demonstrates that community assembly is a result of multiple processes differing in spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that extensive mowing at local scale, as well as giving a high conservation priority to grasslands with high habitat connectivity at regional scale, is the promising actions to maintain endangered native grassland species in suburban landscapes with negative legacy effects of earthmoving.",NA,NA,2020,"WILEY","2020 FEB","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION",10,"3","1311","1323","10.1002/ece3.5985","2045-7758","WOS:000506416600001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Tsuzuki, Yoichi et al.

Here, we highlight arguments for the necessary inclusion of land-use legacies in this endeavour. Alterations in resources and conditions engendered by previous land use, together with influences on plant community processes such as dispersal, selection, drift and speciation, have steered communities and ecosystem functions onto trajectories of change. These trajectories may be modulated by contemporary environmental changes such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition. We performed a literature review which suggests that these potential interactions have rarely been investigated. This crucial oversight is potentially due to an assumption that knowledge of the contemporary state allows accurate projection into the future. Lessons from other complex dynamic systems, and the recent recognition of the importance of previous conditions in explaining contemporary and future ecosystem properties, demand the testing of this assumption. Vegetation resurvey databases across gradients of land use and environmental change, complemented by rigorous experiments, offer a means to test for interactions between land-use legacies and multiple environmental changes. Implementing these tests in the context of a trait-based framework will allow biologists to synthesize compositional and functional ecosystem responses.

It has been therefore proposed to classify forest plant species according to their affinity for ancient or recent patches. In this contribution, we aimed at providing a dynamical perspective on this static concept of ancient/recent forest species. We developed an inference method to estimate the metapopulation dynamics of forest plants based on landscape history and static (and incomplete) biodiversity data accounting for false absence records. We assessed the power of this novel inference method using simulated metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We finally applied this method to occupancy data of 174 and 121 forest species in two networks of 9208 and 9201 forest patches respectively. These patch networks are located in two French regions, with corresponding landscape historical data based on two forest maps conceived in 1840 and 2000. Our analyses revealed that i) the inference method enables to satisfactorily infer three parameters of the metapopulation model: the rates of colonization, extinction and decay of colonization with distance; ii) this three parameter metapopulation model is sufficient to reproduce the occurrence spatial structure of 72% and 61% of the investigated species in the two regions; iii) forest plant species are distributed along a spectrum of turn-over speed, in which small (large) colonization capacity are associated with small (large) propensity to extinction; iv) species position along this spectrum can be partially predicted from plant functional traits; and v) species metapopulation dynamics are driven by the interaction between landscape and species intrinsic properties, suggesting that ancient/recent forest species lists are unlikely to be easily extrapolated to novel landscapes.

This paper investigates the legacies of European settlement of Noosa Shire, South-east Queensland, with particular emphasis on the economic and political drivers and the resultant loss and fragmentation of Koala Phascolarctos cinereus habitat. Patterns of habitat loss between 1860 and 1970 were quantified at a coarse level from historical and land tenure records, while changes over the past 30 years were mapped at a finer spatial resolution from aerial photography and satellite imagery. Periods of high economic growth and to lesser extents depression are linked to increased vegetation clearing. Fifty per cent of P. cinereus habitat has been lost since 1860, with habitat class 2A (30ltoreq50 per cent of preferred habitat trees) and 2C (10ltoreq30 per cent of preferred habitat trees) suffering the highest proportion of loss. The period of greatest habitat loss was between 1890 and 1910, linked to the development of the dairy industry in the western half of Noosa Shire. A second significant phase of loss occurred since 1970, linked to the planting of exotic pine plantations, urbanisation and rural subdivision, with 35 per cent of remaining habitat being cleared, mainly in the southern part of the Shire. The cumulative loss of habitat has been accompanied by increasing levels of habitat fragmentation indicated by reduced patch size and increased patch linearity. Further analysis of the temporal aspects of habitat change is required in order to test the hypothesis that there is a relaxation period between the timing of habitat loss and current pattern of habitat occupancy of P. cinereus populations.",NA,NA,2003,NA,"2003","Australian Zoologist",32,"3","446","461",NA,"0067-2238","BCI:BCI200400112476",NA,NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Seabrook, L.

Its influence in laboratory experimental systems has however been questioned. In fact, other factors involved in long-term population persistence, like habitat size, were usually found to explain most of the dynamics of experimental populations. To better understand the respective influence of short- and long-term factors and their potential interaction on extinction dynamics in experimental systems, we investigated the influence of propagule pressure, habitat size and genetic background on the early dynamics of laboratory-based populations of a hymenopteran parasitoid. The amount of demographic variance differed between establishment and persistence phase and was influenced by habitat size and genetic background (geographic strain), but independent of propagule pressure. In contrast, the probability of extinction within five generations depended on the genetic background and on the interaction between propagule pressure and habitat size. Vulnerability to extinction in small size habitats was increased when populations were founded with a small number of individuals, but this effect was delayed until the third to fifth generations. These results indicate that demographic stochasticity is influential during population establishment, but is not affected by the genetic variability of propagules. On the other hand, extinction might be influenced by a genetic Allee effect triggered by the combination of low propagule pressure and genetic drift. Finally, we documented consistent differences between genetic backgrounds in both deterministic and stochastic population dynamics patterns, with major consequences on extinction risk and ultimately population establishment.",NA,NA,2013,"WILEY","2013 MAY","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY",82,"3","621","631","10.1111/1365-2656.12051","0021-8790 and 1365-2656","WOS:000317863400013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Vercken, Elodie et al.

Numerous studies have explored the relationship between contemporary human activities and different biodiversity metrics, but the influence of past activities, such as land-use, remains poorly understood despite being one of the oldest human impacts. Here we evaluate the role of past land-use modifications in the current distribution and conservation status of mammals worldwide using spatial data characterizing human land use from ca BC 6000 to ca AD 2000. First, we applied a clustering method that revealed three generalized past human land-use trajectories that represent low-, recently- and steadily-used areas widely represented across the globe. Second, we fitted boosted regression trees to predict total and threatened mammalian richness, globally and within trajectory-clusters, testing the role of environmental factors and multiple human land-use metrics reflecting: total used area at different time spans, rates of land-use change, and the occurrence of remarkable land-use shifts. Environmental factors were identified as the main correlates of current mammalian richness, but several proposed metrics of past land-use were also relevant predictors. Overall, these results highlight the likely existence of a land-use legacy in some regions of the world that has influenced the distribution of extant mammals, particularly of those currently classified as threatened. Even if we cannot change that legacy, our results show that we need to account for past human impacts to understand present biodiversity patterns and, arguably, to guide future actions.",NA,NA,2019,"WILEY","2019 OCT","ECOGRAPHY",42,"10","1623","1635","10.1111/ecog.04406","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000485028100001","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Polaina, Ester et al.

However, defining the realized niche of a species is problematic due to variation across spatial and temporal scales. In this study we tested the hypothesis that habitat parameters defining the realized niche of a species can be derived from a regional study and that national changes in land use influence the perception of the realized niche across different landscapes. We described the realized habitat niche of the threatened dragonfly Leucorrhinia pectoralis, in four Estonian landscapes which all have undergone more than 20 years of habitat degradations. We recorded the presence/absence of L. pectoralis and measured 7 habitat variables for 140 lakes and ponds located in one restored and three un-restored landscapes. Lake size and proportion of short riparian vegetation were significantly positive parameters determining the presence of L. pectoralis across landscape types. The species was much more habitat specific in the restored landscape, with larger influence of other habitat parameters. Our data suggest that the realized niche of the species in the un-restored landscapes was constrained by the present-day habitats. The study demonstrate that if a species realized niche is derived from local distribution patterns without incorporating landscape history it can lead to an erroneous niche definition.

The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.",NA,NA,2019,"WILEY","2019 JUN","NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY",37,"6",NA,NA,"10.1111/njb.02175","0107-055X and 1756-1051","WOS:000473066300003","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Lampinen, Jussi (2019) Disturbance, Microclimate and Historical Habitat Connectivity Determine the Population Performance of the Threatened Grassland Specialist Carex Caryophyllea in Remnant Grasslands. <i>Jour</i>.

Immediately after habitat loss, species occurrences are not in equilibrium with the new landscape and more closely reflect the previous landscape structure. Species with slow colonisation-extinction dynamics may display long time-lags before reaching a new equilibrium. We investigated the importance of connectivity to current and historical dispersal sources with the aim of explaining the occurrence pattern of epiphytic lichens with different traits among 104 old oaks. We used oak survey data collected from 1830 and 2009 for a Swedish landscape where oak densities declined drastically shortly after 1830. We fitted a commonly used connectivity measure and estimated the confidence interval for the spatial scale parameter. Small differences in the spatial scale parameter resulted in large differences in model fit. Connectivity to trees in 1830 better explained the occurrence of three of the four species compared to the connectivity in 2009. The explanatory power of the historical landscape structure was highest for the species with traits that may result in a low colonisation rate-both a narrow niche (here few suitable trees) and large dispersal propagules. The results suggest that oak-dependent epiphytic lichens have not reached equilibrium with the spatial landscape structure 180 years after the drastic decline in habitat. For the long-term persistence of epiphytes associated with old trees, conservation efforts should focus on (1) protecting and restoring stands where specialised species with large dispersal propagules (i.e. with low colonisation rates) occur today and (2) promoting tree regeneration in their near vicinity.",NA,NA,2013,"SPRINGER","2013 JUN","OECOLOGIA",172,"2","607","615","10.1007/s00442-012-2509-3","0029-8549 and 1432-1939","WOS:000319077100029","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Johansson, Victor et al.

For shade-intolerant epiphytic species occurring on old trees in semi-open landscapes, host tree numbers have further decreased because of shading by developing secondary woodland. Moreover, in this habitat, regeneration that could replace the extant old trees is low. This suggests that epiphytic species associated with old trees are declining. However, for species with low extinction rates, the decline may be slow and hard to elucidate. We investigated the persistence of five old-oak-associated epiphytic lichens with different traits by simulating metapopulation dynamics using Bayesian incidence function models for dynamic landscapes. With an oak-rich landscape as a reference, we investigated effects of (i) drastic habitat decline, (ii) conservation actions such as clearing around trees or increased regeneration rate, (iii) low tree regeneration and (iv) clearing and increased regeneration after 100years of low regeneration. After drastic habitat decline, the number of occupied trees continued to decrease, displaying long time-lags before reaching new metapopulation equilibriums. Lichen extinction risks increased with decreasing habitat and were highest for species that only colonise very old trees or have large dispersal propagules. In landscapes with low tree densities, conservation actions had only minor effects on lichen extinction risks. Low tree regeneration rates increased lichen extinction risks, but species declines were slow. Conservation actions that increased regeneration after 100years of low regeneration decreased the extinction risks to very low levels. Synthesis and applications. Due to low rates of local extinction, epiphytes display long time-lags to reach new equilibriums after habitat loss. Thus, we should expect ongoing declines in epiphyte metapopulations in landscapes where old trees have recently declined. Slow extinction gives an opportunity to improve persistence by conservation actions, but the success depends on species traits and the current density of old trees. In landscapes with many old but few young trees, epiphytes may persist if conservation actions quickly address the need to increase tree regeneration rates. The best conservation approach for long-term persistence of epiphytic lichens is to ensure regular tree regeneration in landscapes with a current high density of old trees.",NA,NA,2013,"WILEY","2013 APR","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY",50,"2","414","422","10.1111/1365-2664.12049","0021-8901 and 1365-2664","WOS:000316969300015","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Johansson, Victor et al.

I provide a perspective on land-use legacies and forest change, with a particular emphasis on landscapes, and using the example of forestry in the United Kingdom. Methods For this purpose, I undertook a comprehensive review of scholarly forestry literature and of relevant policy and legal documents in the UK, covering the last 100 years. Results This brief review of the dynamics of forest landscapes in the UK over the last 100 years, shows that certain decisions, policies and management activities had major effects on the landscape, especially in terms of landscape patterns and species distribution, constraining it until today. Historic research investigated some of these legacies, leading to real change in policy and management, including a Broadleaved Policy, an Ancient Woodland Inventory, habitat restoration, habitat network and rewilding schemes. Research on past experiences of Dutch Elm disease in the UK and of similar outbreaks in other countries have guided responses to today's tree pest/disease outbreaks and plant trade decisions.

Recently, the ability of established approaches to identify reliably the differential effects of landscape structure (e. g. land-cover composition, remnant vegetation configuration and extent) on the mobility of organisms has been questioned. More explicit methods of predicting and testing for such effects must move beyond post hoc explanations for single landscapes and species. Here, we document a process for making a priori predictions, using existing spatial and ecological data and expert opinion, of the effects of landscape structure on genetic structure of multiple species across replicated landscape blocks. We compare the results of two common methods for estimating the influence of landscape structure on effective distance: least-cost path analysis and isolation-by-resistance. We present a series of alternative models of genetic connectivity in the study area, represented by different landscape resistance surfaces for calculating effective distance, and identify appropriate null models. The process is applied to ten species of sympatric woodland-dependant birds. For each species, we rank a priori the expectation of fit of genetic response to the models according to the expected response of birds to loss of structural connectivity and landscape-scale tree-cover. These rankings (our hypotheses) are presented for testing with empirical genetic data in a subsequent contribution.

Their decline may hence lead to serious ecological and economic impacts, making it essential to understand the processes that drive pollinator shifts in space and time. Land-use changes are thought to be one of the most important drivers of pollinators' loss, and there is increasing investment on pollinator-friendly landscape management. However, it is still unclear whether landscape history of a given region determines how pollinator communities respond to further landscape modification.LocationThe Netherlands.MethodsUsing geographically explicit historical landscape and pollinator data from the Netherlands, we evaluated how species richness changes of three important pollinator groups (bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are affected by landscape changes related to habitat composition, fragmentation and species spillover potential and whether such effects depend on the historical characteristics of the landscape.ResultsThe effect of landscape changes varied between different pollinator groups. While bumblebee richness benefited from increases in edges between managed and natural systems, other bees benefited from increases in landscape heterogeneity and hoverfly richness was fairly resistant to land-use changes. We found that for the majority of the pollinators past landscape characteristics conditioned, the more recent pollinator richness changes. Landscapes that historically had more suitable habitat were more susceptible to display hoverfly declines (caused by drivers not considered in this study). Landscapes that historically had greater spillover potential were more likely to suffer butterfly richness declines and the bumblebee assemblages were more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.Main conclusionsThe diversity of responses of the pollinator groups suggest that multispecies approaches that take group-specific responses to land-use change into account are highly valuable.

The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition and forest adaptive capacity. In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long-term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose 'regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. Using U.S. Forest Service-Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid-Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance and land use) were associated with both low-regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease-prone and/or suboptimal species. Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid-Atlantic region will likely lead to long-term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest-dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration.

A further major criticism of current ecological impact assessments is that they tend to be qualitative. Here we develop methods that apply the Incidence Function Model (IFM) in real urban planning contexts, by generating repeatable and comparable quantitative measures of ecological impacts. To demonstrate the methods for a case study (Nottingham, UK), we estimated landscape-scale measures of species' persistence that indicate metapopulation viability. We based these on Nottingham's landscape when urban developments were recently proposed, then adjust the land cover to include the proposed developments, and also for two projected landscapes where 10% and 20% of the original natural or semi-natural land cover is lost. We find that the IFM shows promise as a tool for quantitative landscape-scale ecological impact assessment, depending on the size of the impact. We detected minimal differences in the species' viability measures between the original and post -development landscapes. This suggests that for small (around 2%) cumulative losses ofnatural/semi-natural space, current site-based approaches are sufficient. However, when the cumulative effect of continued development was modelled by increasing the losses of natural/semi-natural land cover to 10-20% of existing cover, the impact on many of the species studied was more substantial. This indicates that a landscape scale approach is necessary for larger, prolonged and cumulative habitat losses.",NA,NA,2018,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","2018 FEB","LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING",170,NA,"187","194","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.10.008","0169-2046 and 1872-6062","WOS:000419412400017","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Graham, Laura J. et al.

We used a hurdle model to examine occupancy and abundance patterns while addressing problems associated with zero-inflated data. Occupancy patterns were weakly related to percent of the wetland containing emergent vegetation, whereas abundance patterns were predicted by the percent silt in the wetland substrate, percent forest cover, amount of habitat degradation, and recovery time since past habitat degradation. The effect of historical habitat degradation on abundance rather than occupancy patterns has rarely been documented and its effect is rarely studied in vertebrate populations.

Open canopy structure had been maintained by both natural- and human-induced disturbances. In the past two centuries, suppression of such disturbances, together with forestry intensification, has turned most lowland woodlands into closed-canopy forests. We investigated the effect of increased canopy closure on veteran trees and several threatened beetles associated with them.Location: Floodplain woodlands along the lower Dyje and Morava rivers, Czech Republic.Methods: We used an approach combining the study of aerial photographs with on-ground survey of veteran trees and associated endangered beetles. The aerial images were used to obtain the information on historical (1938) and recent (2009) canopy closure in the area of 146 km(2), where we mapped large oaks (d.b.h. >70 cm), hollow trees and three associated beetles including the hermit beetle (Osmoderma barnabita), the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo) and the jewel beetle Eurythyrea quercus.Results: The presence of large oaks, hollow trees and their associated beetle species are negatively related to recent high canopy closure, and the historical level of canopy closure matters, as in nowadays closed-canopy stands, the beetles and veteran trees are more common in places that were rather open in 1938 than in the places with closed canopy already in 1938. Moreover, the health state of veteran trees highly depends on the canopy closure.Main conclusion: The negative effect of canopy closure on veteran trees and their endangered inhabitants is several decades delayed and may thus often go undetected. In the forests, however, large and hollow trees and their associated biodiversity are relics of the past, more open conditions. The restoration of open woodlands is therefore vital for preventing their further decline.

In part, this is due to a lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40 longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields) supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape effects did not influence the total number of species in either historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level, landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use history and landscape effects during restoration.",NA,NA,2011,"WILEY","2011 APR","ECOGRAPHY",34,"2","257","266","10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06381.x","0906-7590 and 1600-0587","WOS:000289150000008","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Brudvig, Lars A. et al.

We tested the effect of three historical variables on current forest plant communities and traits: forest temporal continuity (ancient: forested before 1860, recent: reforested after 1860, and very recent forest: reforested after 1958) and type of land use in 1860 and 1958 (forest, pasture or arable land). Location The Regional Natural Park of Luberon (southeastern France). Methods We used a comprehensive vegetation plot database (473 species in 1,429 plots). Species' response to historical variables was tested with logistic regressions, and the relationship between plant traits and historical variables was analysed with RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Results Among all studied species, 250 responded to forest temporal continuity, 208 to 1860 land use, and 246 to 1958 land use. Species associated with ancient forests were more frequently forest specialists or forest edge species, shade-tolerant and perennials, while species associated with recent and very recent forests were more frequently annuals, anemochorous and heliophilous species. Species exhibited different traits and ecological preferences according to the type of land use prior to forest: therophytes were more frequent on former arable land while chamaephytes were more frequent on former pasture. Trait responses to 1860 and 1958 land uses were globally consistent. Conclusions The effect of forest temporal continuity and past land use on forest understorey communities was consistent with other studies in northern Europe or northern America, which suggests that the same ecological processes apply in temperate lowland and Mediterranean regions. This study highlights a succession of plant communities in the long term and different trajectories of succession according to the type of former agricultural use.

Recently-developed models of stochastic community assembly allow us to predict the evolution of communities on the basis of mechanistic processes at the level of individuals. The neutral model of biodiversity, in particular, has provided closed-form solutions for the relaxation of biodiversity in isolated communities (no immigration or speciation). Here, we extend these results by deriving a relaxation curve for a neutral community in which new species are introduced through the mechanism of random fission speciation (RFS). The solution provides simple closed-form expressions for the equilibrium species richness, the relaxation time and the species-individual curve, which are good approximation to the more complicated formulas existing for the same model. The derivation of the relaxation curve is based on the assumption of a broken-stick species-abundance distribution (SAD) as an initial community configuration; yet for commonly observed SADs, the maximum deviation from the curve does not exceed 10%. Importantly, the solution confirms theoretical results and observations showing that the relaxation time increases with community size and thus habitat area.

However, the effectiveness of tree retention for maintaining biodiversity for more than a few years is still poorly known. We investigated lichen persistence in retained buffer strips along small streams after clear-cutting of the surrounding forest, and compared with clear-cuts and un-cut references. Specifically, we compared richness and frequency of red-listed/signal species, calicioids and pendulous species before clear cutting with 2.5 years and 16.5 years after clear-cutting, and also analysed their colonization-extinction dynamics over time. The results show that the richness of red-listed/signal species and calicioids in buffer strips had declined significantly after 16.5 years, but not after 2.5 years, while frequency displayed a significant difference already after 2.5 years. The richness of pendulous lichens remained relatively stable over time, but the frequency had declined significantly after 16.5 years. In clear-cuts all groups declined more than in buffer-strips (-2-3.5 times more) and the main decline had occurred already after 2.5 years. References remained stable over time. The colonization-extinctions dynamics reflected the richness declines, with high early extinction in clear cuts and lower but late extinction in buffer-strips, and low (re)colonization. We conclude that retained buffer strips cannot maintain lichen richness over time due to time-lagged extinction, but they are clearly more effective than clear-cuts.

Common models predict coherent change in assemblages, with less numerous species becoming locally extinct first, then species of intermediate abundance, and so forth. Relative-abundance distributions should change systematically in landscapes characterized by greater change. Such a predictable sequence of change is not evident in the avifaunas of landscapes of central Victoria, Australia, where relative-abundance patterns in more affected landscapes bear little resemblance to reference distributions. I provide two sets of analyses of relative-abundance distributions: ( 1) analyses that do not depend on the identity of individual species and ( 2) abundance spectra, which use ordered lists of species ranked by species' commonness in reference systems. While abundance spectra change dramatically in smaller remnants, relative-abundance distributions change little, suggesting that the ""reorganization"" of abundances occurs over ecological time frames. The dispersal-limited multinomial is a flexible distribution that may fit many data sets yet be unrelated to assumptions ( species neutrality) and processes ( fixed total numbers of individuals) of the unified neutral theory.

Do the effects from the time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant species?LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden.MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time.ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64% higher total species richness and 110% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of finding a forest species increased.ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation.

In mountainous regions, we typically observe an uphill shift of species' altitudinal ranges caused by increasing temperatures, but it is difficult to predict how this process interacts with land-use change. Here, we replicated an inventory of bumblebees that took place in the 1960s in Norway. Focusing on subalpine areas, we reported changes in species richness and community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, at low and high altitude. Using aerial photographs and meteorological data, we tested the relationship between climate and land-cover changes and changes in species richness and CTI. We observed an overall increase in CTI consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. There was on average an increase in species richness at high altitudes, while low-altitudes communities tendedto become less species-rich. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between species richness and temperature and precipitation trends, suggesting a detrimental effect of climate change. Thanks to the replication of an historical inventory, we were able to show evidence for an effect of climate, and possibly land-cover, change on subalpine bumblebee assemblages.

We studied plant species assembly in grasslands with differing habitat history and hypothesised that trait divergence prevails in historical grasslands due to niche differentiation and trait convergence prevails in more dynamic grasslands due to competitive exclusion and dispersal limitation. We tested these hypotheses in 35 grassland complexes in Estonia, containing neighbouring grassland habitats with different land-use histories: continuously managed open historical grassland, currently overgrown former grassland and young developing grassland. We assessed species assembly patterns in each grassland type for finer scale-a 2 x 2 m plot scale from a local community pool and for broader scale-a local community from the habitat species pool for that grassland stage and observed changes in trait means at finer scale. We found that grasslands with long management history are assembled differently from former grasslands or young developing grasslands. In historical grasslands, divergence or random patterns prevailed at finer scale species assembly while in former or developing grasslands, mostly convergence patterns prevailed. With increasing scale convergence patterns become more prevalent in all grassland types.

Conservation strategies and species risk evaluations often rely exclusively on current aspects of landscape structure, although such limited assumptions are known to be misleading when time-lag responses occur. By relating bird functional-group richness to forest patch size and isolation in ten-year intervals (1956, 1965, 1978, 1984, 1993 and 2003), we revealed that birds with different sensitivity to fragmentation display contrasting responses to landscape dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For non-sensitive groups, there was no time-lag in response: the recent degree of isolation best explains their variation in richness, which likely relates to these species' flexibility to adapt to changes in landscape structure. However, for sensitive bird groups, the 1978 patch area was the best explanatory variable, providing evidence for a 25-year time-lag in response to habitat reduction. Time-lag was more likely in landscapes that encompass large patches, which can support temporarily the presence of some sensitive species, even when habitat cover is relatively low. These landscapes potentially support the most threatened populations and should be priorities for restoration efforts to avoid further species loss. Although time-lags provide an opportunity to counteract the negative consequences of fragmentation, it also reinforces the urgency of restoration actions. Fragmented landscapes will be depleted of biodiversity if landscape structure is only maintained, and not improved. The urgency of restoration action may be even higher in landscapes where habitat loss and fragmentation history is older and where no large fragment remained to act temporarily as a refuge.",NA,NA,2016,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","2016 JAN 28","PLOS ONE",11,"1",NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0147909","1932-6203","WOS:000369528400053","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Uezu, Alexandre et al.

Landscape change is widely considered as a major threat to species loss at a regional and global scale. However, how species diversity responds to landscape changes on a temporal scale has usually been ignored. In this study, we explored relationships between landscape and biodiversity (species level and functional group level) during different years (1975, 1990, 2000 and 2010) at the Yimin open-pit coal mine, a mine that has been exploited for more than 30 years and that has produced obvious fragmentation effects on the landscape in Hulunbuir City. The ongoing patterns of transformation of the landscape were measured using the landscape dominance index, the habitat integral index of connectivity (IIC), and the habitat probability of connectivity (PC) at seven different spatial scales. The main results were as follows: The present species diversity is significantly correlated with the landscape pattern indices of previous and earlier mining at a medium-sized spatial scale (4-8 km buffers). Different plant functional groups responded in various ways to changing landscape patterns. The species richness of perennial rhizome grasses was significantly correlated with the present small-scale landscape pattern (1-3 km), and the species richness of perennial forbs was significantly correlated with the previous and earlier mining large-scale landscape patterns (4-10 km). Perennial bunchgrasses were not significantly correlated with landscape patterns. We concluded that the time lag expressed by changes in plant species diversity occurred in response to changing patterns of construction and configurations of habitats in the landscape. The regional species pool determined the local species diversity. The connected habitat patches within a 4-8 km buffer region represented the principal species pool.

Location The northern part of the Stockholm archipelago, Baltic Sea, Sweden. We resurveyed 27 islands ranging from 0.3 to 33 ha in area. Methods We compared current plant survey data, cadastral maps and aerial photographs with records obtained from a survey in 1908, using databases and a digital elevation model to examine changes in plant community dynamics in space and time. We examined the effects of local and landscape structure and land use changes on plant species dynamics by using stepwise regression in relation to eight local and three landscape variables. The eight local variables were area, relative age, shape, soil heterogeneity, bedrock ratio, number of houses, forest cover change, and grazing 100 years ago. The three landscape variables were distance to mainland, distance to closest island with a farm 100 years ago, and structural connectivity. Hanskis connectivity measure was modified to incorporate both connectivity and fragmentation. Results The investigated islands have undergone drastic changes, with increasing forest cover, habitation, and abandonment of grassland management. Although the total species richness increased by 31% and mean island area by 23%, we found no significant increase in species richness per unit area. Local variables explain past species richness (100 years ago), whereas both local and landscape variables explain current species richness, extinctions, immigrations and species turnover. Grazing that occurred 100 years ago still influences species richness, even though grazing management was abandoned several decades ago. The evidence clearly shows an increase in nitrophilous plant species, particularly among immigrant species. Main conclusions This study highlights the importance of including land use history when interpreting current patterns of species richness. Furthermore, local environment and landscape patterns affect important ecological processes such as immigration, extinction and species turnover, and hence should be included when assessing the impact of habitat fragmentation and land use change. We suggest that our modified structural connectivity measure can be applied to other types of landscapes to investigate the effects of fragmentation and habitat loss.",NA,NA,2012,"WILEY","2012 SEP","JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY",39,"9","1645","1656","10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02733.x","0305-0270 and 1365-2699","WOS:000307562200009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Aggemyr, Elsa et al.

Increased human disturbance often results in declining local native species richness, gains in exotic species and a decline in beta diversity. However, it is far from certain whether a general decline in plant diversity is occurring across all disturbed landscapes, and knowledge gaps remain concerning how the spread of exotic species influences beta diversity over long time-scales. We resurveyed 184 vegetation plots in three broad vegetation types on southern Vancouver Island, Canada, originally surveyed in the late 1960s. This landscape has experienced a high degree of human disturbance over the past 40years due to urbanization. We examined changes in total diversity, local diversity and beta diversity over time. We also compiled information on the traits of each species and tested for correlations between traits and plant species success over four decades. We found striking increases in local and total plant species richness driven by both native and exotic species. The most successful species tended to be exotic, disturbance tolerant, shade tolerant and shrubs. Biotic homogenization occurred, but not as a result of exotic species colonization, instead being significantly correlated with gains in native species. The loss in beta diversity has resulted in a shrinking of the gradient of vegetation types, blurring the distinction between them.Synthesis. Our study shows that human-mediated disturbance is the dominant driver of plant community changes, but the net result has actually been an increase in richness, for each plot and for all plots pooled, and for both natives and exotics, despite a decline in variability among plant communities on the landscape. Contrary to conventional definitions of biotic homogenization, this decline in beta diversity was not correlated with the spread of exotic species, but with the colonization of common, disturbance-tolerant natives.",NA,NA,2013,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","2013 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",101,"6","1542","1551","10.1111/1365-2745.12156","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000325984300017","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"McCune, Jenny L. et al.

We used spatially explicit population models requiring detailed habitat and demographic data to evaluate the ability of existing park systems in the Rocky Mountain region (U.S.A. and Canada) to sustain populations of mammalian carnivores. Predicted patterns of extirpation agreed with those from logistic-regression models based only on park size and connectedness (or isolation) for the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in developed landscapes (northern US. Rocky Mountains) and semideveloped landscapes (southern Canadian Rocky Mountains). The area-isolation model performed poorly where the landscape matrix contained large amounts of suitable habitat (northern Canadian Rocky Mountains). Park area and connectedness were poor predictors of gray wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence because of this species' broader-scale range dynamics and greater ability to inhabit the landscape matrix. A doubling of park area corresponded to a 47% and 57% increase in projected grizzly bear population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively. A doubling of a park's connectedness index corresponded to a 81% and 350% increase in population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively, suggesting that conservation planning to enhance connectivity may be most effective in the earliest stages of landscape degradation. The park area and connectivity required for population persistence increased as the landscape matrix became more hostile, implying that the relatively small combined area of parks in the boreal forest and other undeveloped regions may fall below the threshold for species persistence if parks become habitat islands. Loss of carnivores from boreal landscapes could further reduce the viability of temperate populations occupying refugia at the southern range margin. Spatially realistic population models may be more informative than simplerpatch-matrix models in predicting the effects of landscape change on population viability across a continuum of landscape degradation.",NA,NA,2004,"WILEY","2004 AUG","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY",18,"4","1110","1120","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00083.x","0888-8892 and 1523-1739","WOS:000222979400031","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Carroll, C et al.

Especially taxa with specific habitat demands and low dispersal behaviour suffer from habitat fragmentation. One such taxon, the Chalk-hill Blue butterfly, Polyommatus coridon, nowadays mostly occurs in small and isolated, calcareous grasslands across Central Europe. Here we investigate the population genetic structure of 15 local populations of this butterfly species over major parts of the Frankische Schweiz (south-east Germany). Based on seven polymorphic microsatellites we estimate genetic diversity and differentiation. We use the data to test for potential effects of different habitat sizes, habitat connectivity, and population density. We found high genetic diversity but no significant genetic differentiation among the 15 local populations (F (ST) = 0.0087, P > 0.05). Genetic diversity was not correlated with habitat size, habitat connectivity, or census population size. But, we found a marginally positive correlation between increasing habitat connectivity and population density (r (2) = 0.31, P < 0.05). Compared to other butterfly species, our data resemble a generalist species with well connected populations rather than a specialist taxon existing in a highly fragmented landscape.

Whereas the importance of all these factors has been investigated in a range of previous studies, our understanding of the effects of individual traits on species dependence on landscape structure is still rather limited.

We tested the importance of species traits for species response to the landscape structure.ResultsIn addition to habitat conditions, species composition was determined by landscape structures in the past and at present, and the past landscape structure in each time period separately was equally important to the present landscape structure. Perennial species that are insect- or wind-pollinated, flower over limited periods of time, are relatively tall, are dispersed by animals, are not ruderal, have low nutrient requirements and maintain competitive or partly stress-tolerant strategies were found to be restricted to continuous localities existing at least since 1973 or 1988 and to localities that are currently well interconnected. In contrast, short, self-pollinated, ruderal species prevail in currently less-connected localities.ConclusionsThe results indicate that knowledge of the past landscape structure is important for understanding the current species distribution, and that species traits can be used as useful predictors of species responses to the past landscape structure.",NA,NA,2016,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","2016 MAY","JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE",27,"3","545","556","10.1111/jvs.12390","1100-9233 and 1654-1103","WOS:000375147500013","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Husakova, Iveta et al.

However, little is known about the effects of initial site conditions, such as soil acidity or soil moisture, on these long-term responses and how multiple drivers interact with each other in affecting herb layer diversity and composition. Moreover, the extent to which local changes in canopy cover and composition may mimic or counterbalance effects of regional or global drivers is largely unexplored. Here, we resurveyed herb layer vegetation plots in northeastern Germany after more than five decades. Our main objectives were (1) to determine the effects of initial site conditions, here soil pH buffer range, on herb layer and environmental changes; (2) to disentangle the effects of presumed regional and global drivers from local changes in canopy density and composition; and (3) to identify interactions between environmental drivers in affecting species diversity and composition. We observed significant changes in species diversity and environmental conditions, mostly in dependence on the initial site conditions. Species richness increased only at moderately acidic to base-rich sites, while floristic distinctiveness (beta diversity) generally decreased but decreased significantly stronger on base-rich than on acidic sites. The indicated environmental changes comprised increased shading (particularly on acidic sites), a decrease in soil moisture, acidification (only on initially moderately acidic to base-rich sites), eutrophication (only on acidic sites), an increase in browsing pressure and more continental climatic conditions, probably in terms of increased summer drought (on well-drained sites only). The presumed regional/global environmental changes could not be explained by local changes in canopy composition. The herb layer responses were affected by several important interactions among the drivers. The floristic homogenization was more pronounced the stronger the eutrophication signal, but only on (moderately) acidic sites, while the homogenization occurred independent of any eutrophication on base-rich sites. The environmental change indicators for soil acidity and nitrogen availability showed opposing effects on temporal species turnover and a positive interaction, pointing to atmospheric deposition as the most important driver. Our study demonstrates that both initial site conditions and interactions between different drivers should be taken into account in resurvey studies to broaden our understanding of plant community responses to environmental changes.

The loss of grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.Past and present grassland distribution was a major factor in determining plant species patterns found in grasslands today. All landscapes had an average of 80% grassland 300 years ago. Since then grassland has declined by 90% across all landscapes. Proportion of clay soils influenced the timing of grassland decline, where grasslands in landscapes dominated by clay soils were conversed to crop-fields more than 100 years ago. Grasslands on coarser soils declined later, primarily to forest. Landscapes with more than 10% semi-natural grassland left today had 50% higher species richness in all grasslands, including both abandoned and new grassland. Time since major grassland decline also seems to have an effect on the landscapes' species richness. The results show that plant species patterns in grasslands at local scales are determined by broader landscape processes which may have occurred many centuries ago. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, although stream ecosystems are tightly coupled with their catchments and, thus, probably are affected strongly by historical catchment conditions, few studies have directly examined the importance of landuse legacies on streams. We examined relationships between historical land use (1944) and contemporary (2000-2003) stream physical, chemical, and biological conditions after accounting for the influences of contemporary land use (1999) and natural landscape (catchment size) variation in 12 small streams at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. Most stream variables showed strong relationships with contemporary land use and catchment size; however, after accounting for these factors, residual variation in many variables remained significantly related to historical land use. Residual variation in benthic particulate organic matter, diatom density, % of diatoms in Eunotia spp., fish density in runs, and whole-stream gross primary productivity correlated negatively, whereas streamwater pH correlated positively, with residual variation in fraction of disturbed land in catchments in 1944 (i.e., bare ground and unpaved road cover). Residual variation in % recovering land (i.e., early successional vegetation) in 1944 was correlated positively with residual variation in streambed instability, a macroinvertebrate biotic index, and fish richness, but correlated negatively with residual variation in most benthic macroinvertebrate metrics examined (e.g., Chironomidae and total richness, Shannon diversity). In contrast, residual variation in whole-stream respiration rates was not explained by historical land use. Our results suggest that historical land use continues to influence important physical and chemical variables in these streams, and in turn, probably influences associated biota.

In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000-2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning.

Little is known about the effects of management practices of old semi-natural field margins, and their historical dimension regarding past management practices and landscape context is rarely considered. In this paper, the relative influence of recent and past management practices and landscape context (during the last five years) were assessed on the local biodiversity (species richness and composition) of carabid assemblages of field margins in agricultural landscapes of northwestern France. The results showed that recent patterns of carabid species richness and composition were best explained by management practices and landscape context measured four or five years ago. It suggests the existence of a time lag in the response of carabid assemblages to past environmental conditions of field margins. The relative contribution of past management practices and past landscape context varied depending on the spatial scale at which landscape context was taken into account. Carabid species richness was higher in grazed or sprayed field margins probably due to increased heterogeneity in habitat conditions. Field margins surrounded by grasslands and crops harbored species associated with open habitats whilst forest species dominated field margins surrounded by woodland. Landscape effect was higher at fine spatial scale, within 50 m around field margins. The present study highlights the importance of considering time-lagged responses of biodiversity when managing environment. It also suggests that old semi-natural field margins should not be considered as undisturbed habitats but more as management units being part of farming activities in agricultural landscapes, as for arable fields.

Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta-analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time.Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time.We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness.Synthesis and applications: Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.Synthesis and applications:Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments.

Total species richness was influenced by present management. size and connectivity to present and past grassland pattern. Landscape variables did not influence species density in grazed semi-natural grassland Suggesting that maintained grazing management makes grassland patches independent of landscape context. The abundance of 16 grassland specialists was Mainly influenced by management and to some extent also by landscape variables.Conclusion: Although species richness pattern reflect management and to some extent landscape variables, the response of individual species may be idiosyncratic. The historical signal from past landscapes is weak on present-day species richness in highly transformed, agricultural landscapes.

The 'passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat(7,8), whereas the 'ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone(9,10). Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments-when controlled for sampling effort-contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.Analysis of 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa from fragmented habitats finds that increasing fragmentation has a disproportionately large effect on biodiversity loss, supporting the ecosystem decay hypothesis.",NA,NA,2020,"NATURE RESEARCH","2020 AUG 13","NATURE",584,"7820","238","+","10.1038/s41586-020-2531-2","0028-0836 and 1476-4687","WOS:000554511600002","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Chase, Jonathan M. et al.

For each species we obtained the values or states for a set of plant functional traits: plant height, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, seed production, seed weight, life form and lateral expansion. To account for the effect of phylogeny, we evaluated trait diversity skewness by means of an ultrametric phylogenetic tree specifically constructed for the species studied. The association between both environmental gradients and past disturbance, and plant functional traits was tested by means of RLQ analysis.ResultsOf all the traits, only seed weight showed a phylogenetic signal; consequently, phylogeny was not included in the RLQ analysis. Conductivity was negatively correlated with seed weight, whereas water table conditions and soil ionic balance were negatively correlated with specific leaf area. Past disturbance was negatively correlated with leaf dry matter content and with lateral expansion.ConclusionsPlant traits of Llobregat Delta coastal marsh communities are conditioned by environmental gradients and by past land use. Soil ionic balance and water table conditions determine key plant functional traits such as specific leaf area. This finding also corroborates the importance of soil ionic balance as a plant life driver in microtidal Mediterranean marshes.

Forests growing on kames, eskers and various moraine hillocks common in regions with Holocene glaciation are good examples of this approach. In Estonia, these forests locally persist as fragments of continuous primary forest, but usually they are situated on former slash-and-burn areas (bushlands) or reforested agricultural land. Our aim was to elucidate the strength of the effect of long-term land-use history on the present-day vegetation compositions of mature hillock forests and their soil chemistry. It appeared that even the mature secondary hillock forests are still distinct from historically continuous stands in terms of species composition. We discovered connections between stand history and species content in hillock forests as well as transformed soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen contents in the humus horizons of secondary forests are lower while their carbon-nitrogen ratios are higher than in continuous forests. The relationship between vegetation and stand history is demonstrated by the higher proportions of anthropophytic and apophytic species in the herb layer of the secondary forests. The presence of species that are tolerant of anthropogenic impact on the secondary hillock forests floor can also be partly explained by the effect of different species in the tree and shrub layers, gaps in the tree canopy, and the boundary effect caused by the small areas of forest patches, neighboring grasslands or fields.

Researchers and land managers generally assume that the present distributions of biological indicator species are influenced by the current environment. However, recent studies have suggested the importance of past environments to species distributions (i.e., a time lag between changes in species distribution and habitat alterations). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the effects of past environments on the distributions of indicator species.We conducted a survey on the Tokachi Plain in Hokkaido, Japan. We targeted two taxa that have been widely used as indicator species (carabid beetles and bats) and investigated whether past landscape environments influenced their present distributions. We showed that past landscape environments (5 decades prior to the present) influenced the distributions of some ecological trait groups in each taxon (large body size for carabid beetles and a 25 kHz peak echolocation frequency for bats) and that these effects varied among groups. Our results suggest the need to consider the dynamics of land-use changes and the effects of past environments on the distributions of indicator taxa, otherwise we may misunderstand the effects of environmental degradation on biodiversity.

Land-use change is considered one of the most radical and extensive disturbances that have influenced plant distributions and diversity patterns in forest understorey communities in much of Europe and eastern North America. In forests growing on former agricultural land, local species diversity and community differentiation among sites are generally reduced compared with ancient forests (i.e. forests with no historical record of agriculture). Yet, no study has determined how the compositional differences created by former land-use change over time as the forest sites recover from former agricultural use.2. Here, we resurveyed 78 vegetation plots (half of the plots in ancient and half in post-agricultural forest) to demonstrate how three decades of forest development have changed the compositional differences between post-agricultural and ancient forest sites. The impact of land-use history and survey date was tested on two measures of species diversity and two measure of community divergence.3. The data indicate that the imprint of former agricultural land use persisted over time, yet not through compositional stability. Parallel and strong vegetation shifts occurred in both ancient and post-agricultural forest: the species diversity decreased and local species cover strongly diverged, which indicates community drift. The observed understorey changes did thus not support the commonly accepted model of community development in post-agricultural forests, i.e. the diversity did not increase and the vegetation did not become more similar to the ancient forest vegetation over time. The changes in species composition were associated with an increase of common, competitive species at the expense of ancient forest indicator species. The source populations of ancient forest species have been gradually depleted, so the recovery of post-agricultural forests becomes even more precarious.4. Synthesis. While land-use history is likely to persist as the primary predictor of local species diversity and community divergence, other environmental drivers may additionally structure forest understorey communities and lead to biotic impoverishment and pervasive species reordering on the time scale of only decades.",NA,NA,2010,"WILEY","2010 NOV","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",98,"6","1447","1453","10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01711.x","0022-0477 and 1365-2745","WOS:000282978100018","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Baeten, Lander et al.

However, biodiversity may respond slowly to habitat loss, taking time to undergo successional change following a disturbance. Despite the fact that historic processes often mediate current patterns of biodiversity, most studies focus only on contemporary factors.Our research examines how both contemporary and historic environmental factors impact current pollinator community similarity, or beta-diversity. We examine two hypotheses: H1) contemporary land-use predicts community similarity, but also that land-use history has long-lasting effects on beta-diversity; H2) the specific response to contemporary and historic environmental factors is explained by variation in pollinator species life-history traits.We sampled 36 pollinator communities over a three-year period across cotton fields varying in historic and contemporary land-use. Using multiple regression on distance matrices (MRDM), we investigate correlations between community similarity and differences in contemporary and historic environmental factors.First, we show that increased time between sampling events and the loss of semi-natural habitat over a 19-year period led to decreased community similarity. Interestingly, neither geographic distance nor contemporary environmental factors contributed to similarity. Second, we show that much of the variation in community similarity is due to variation in pollinator species life-history traits, such as foraging ability and diet breadth.Results indicate that land-use history has long-lasting effects on community composition, greater than effects exhibited by contemporary factors.

Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time.2. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species.3. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30% higher (with a maximum of 150% higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances (<1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (similar to 30%).4. We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models.",NA,NA,2017,"WILEY","2017 OCT","METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION",8,"10","1253","1264","10.1111/2041-210X.12799","2041-210X and 2041-2096","WOS:000412858600009","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"lit_data/01_final_lit_search/lit_search_webofscience.ris",1,"Martensen, Alexandre Camargo et al.

Given the temporal variability inherent in many ecosystems, long-term studies are important to understand how species respond to landscape change. We revisited a large-scale, natural experiment, 10years after initial surveys to investigate the response of arboreal marsupials to anthropogenic landscape change over time.LocationThe Tumut Fragmentation Study in south-eastern Australia encompasses 50,000ha of contiguous Eucalyptus forests and eucalypt forest remnants surrounded by an exotic pine (Pinus radiata) plantation.MethodsThis study followed an established, statistically rigorous, replicated design that matched remnant eucalypt sites within the plantation to control sites within contiguous eucalypt forests. We recorded the presence and abundance of arboreal marsupials by spotlighting along transects. We used a range of generalized linear models to investigate interactions among independent and dependent variables and test hypotheses established at the outset of the study.ResultsAll of the species observed in eucalypt remnants in 1996 were present in 2007. However, the presence and abundance of some species had changed significantly between periods. Remnant size, isolation, the disturbance history of the pine matrix adjoining remnants, time since pine establishment, and/or the age of the pines were significant factors in explaining the presence and abundance of some species. We identify mechanistic processes that may be responsible for the differing response patterns of the four most common arboreal marsupial species.Main conclusionsMost native forest remnants continued to provide habitat for several arboreal marsupial species over the past decade. These results add considerable weight to recommendations calling for the preservation of native forests remnants during and after plantation establishment.

Forest management objectives that include specific forest age structure may not be easily attained due to constraints imposed by the legacies of historical management and natural disturbance. We used a spatially explicit stochastic model to explore the synergetic effects of forest management and fire on boreal forest age structure. Specifically, we examined (1) the duration of spatial legacies of different management practices in the boreal forest, (2) how multiple shifts in management practices affect legacy duration and the spatial trajectories of forest age structure, and (3) how fire influences legacy duration and pattern development in combination with harvesting. Results based on 30 replicates of 500 years for each scenario indicate that (1) spatial legacies persist over 200 years and the rate at which legacies are overcome depends on whether new management targets are in synchrony with existing spatial pattern; (2) age specific goals were met faster after multiple management shifts due to the similar spatial scale of the preceding management types; (3) because large fires can erase the spatial pattern created by smaller disturbances, scenarios with fire had shorter lags than scenarios without fire. These results suggest that forest management goals can be accelerated by applying management at a similar spatial scale as existing spatial patterns.

In the last few decades, alternatives to clearcutting have gained much interest. Living and dead trees are often retained after harvest to serve as structural legacies to mitigate negative effects of forestry. However, this practice is widely employed without information from systematic before-after control-impact studies to assess the processes involved in species responses after clearcutting with retention. We performed a large-scale survey of the occurrence of logging-sensitive and red-listed bryophytes and lichens before and after clearcutting with the retention approach. A methodology was adopted that, for the first time in studies on retention approaches, enabled monitoring of location-specific substrates. We used uncut stands as controls to assess the variables affecting the survival of species after a major disturbance. In total, 12 bryophyte species and 27 lichen species were analysed. All were classified as sensitive to logging, and most species are also currently red-listed. We found that living and dead trees retained after final harvest acted as refugia in which logging-sensitive species were able to survive for 3 to 7years after logging. Depending on type of retention and organism group, between 35% and 92% of the species occurrences persisted on retained structures. Most species observed outside retention trees or patches disappeared. Larger pre-harvest population sizes of bryophytes on dead wood increased the survival probability of the species and hence buffered the negative effects of logging.Synthesis and applications. Careful spatial planning of retention structures is required to fully embrace the habitats of logging-sensitive species. Bryophytes and lichens persisted to a higher degree in retention patches compared to solitary trees or in the clearcut area. Retaining groups of trees in logged areas will help to sustain populations of species over the clearcut phase. When possible, old logs should be moved into retention patches to provide a more beneficial environment for dead wood-dependent species. Our study also highlights the need for more before-after control-impact studies of retention forestry to explore factors influencing the survival of species after logging.Careful spatial planning of retention structures is required to fully embrace the habitats of logging-sensitive species.
