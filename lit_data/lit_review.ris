AB  - Habitat destruction is driving biodiversity loss in remaining ecosystems, and ecosystem functioning and services often directly depend on biodiversity. Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversity-dependent beneﬁts that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c. 2–21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reﬂects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversity-dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

TI  - Colonization Credit in Restored Wet Heathlands
AU  - Cristofoli, Sara

T2  - Restoration Ecology
AB  - Although human-driven landscape modiﬁcation is generally characterized by habitat destruction and fragmentation, it may also result in the creation of new habitat patches, providing conditions conducive to spontaneous colonization. In this article, we propose the concept of ‘‘colonization credit’’ (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No signiﬁcant colonization credit was identiﬁed either in patches created 25–55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our ﬁrst EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that ﬁrst EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time.

AB  - Methods: Species’ incidences are projected in 9,208 patches of the Seine-­et-­Marne region characterized by strong development of post-­agricultural forests and a moderate erosion of ancient forests during the period 1840–2000. We use a metapopulation model with static biodiversity data and landscape history to project forest plant dynamics. We focus on 33 generalist forest species that are able to colonize both ancient and post-­agricultural forests.
Results: Our analyses reveal that (1) extinction in ancient forests slows the colonization process, which lasts between 250 and 990 years after habitat turnover, depending on species characteristics; (2) the species incidence in post-­agricultural forests converges towards that in ancient forests long before the overall species incidence stabilizes at the landscape scale (i.e. long before the relaxation time); (3) landscape-­ and patch-­scale relaxation times depend on species colonization ability and patch functional connectivity; (4) the colonization process is rather slow for ancient forest species; and (5) the incidence of ancient forest species becomes larger than the incidence of other species at the end of the colonization dynamics thanks to their strong persistence.
Conclusions: Ancient forest species may potentially benefit from a large immigration credit but need centuries to use it. On such time scales, many perturbations are likely to jeopardize the realization of this potential credit.

AB  - The effect of twenty-first-century climate change on biodiversity is commonly forecast based on modelled shifts in species ranges, linked to habitat suitability. These projections have been coupled with species–area relationships (SAR) to infer extinction rates indirectly as a result of the loss of climatically suitable areas and associated habitat. This approach does not model population dynamics explicitly, and so accepts that extinctions might occur after substantial (but unknown) delays—an extinction debt. Here we explicitly couple bioclimatic envelope models of climate and habitat suitability with generic life-history models for 24 species of frogs found in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We show that (i) as many as four species of frogs face imminent extinction by 2080, due primarily to climate change; (ii) three frogs face delayed extinctions; and (iii) this extinction debt will take at least a century to be realized in full. Furthermore, we find congruence between forecast rates of extinction using SARs, and demographic models with an extinction lag of 120 years. We conclude that SAR approaches can provide useful advice to conservation on climate change impacts, provided there is a good understanding of the time lags over which delayed extinctions are likely to occur.

AB  - Destruction and fragmentation of (semi-) natural habitats are considered the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Plant species may exhibit a slow response to fragmentation, resulting in the development of an extinction debt in fragmented plant communities. The detection of extinction debt is of primary importance in habitat conservation strategies. We applied two different approaches proposed in the literature to identify extinction debt in South-East Belgium calcareous grasslands. The ﬁrst method compared species richness between stable and fragmented habitat patches. The second explored correlations between current species richness and current and past landscape conﬁgurations using multiple regression analyses. We subsequently examined results generated by both methods. In addition, we proposed techniques to identify species that are more likely to support extinction debt and associated functional traits. We estimated a respective extinction debt of approximately 28% and 35% of the total and specialist species richness. Similar results were obtained from both methods. We identiﬁed 15 threatened specialist species under the current landscape conﬁguration. It is likely the landscape conﬁguration no longer supports the species habitat requirements. We demonstrated that non-clonal species are most threatened, as well as taxa that cannot persist in degraded habitats and form only sparsely distributed populations. We discussed our results in light of other studies in similar habitats, and the overall implications for habitat conservation.

AB  - A new model of delayed species loss (extinction debt) within isolated communities is applied to a large data set of terrestrial vertebrate assemblages (n = 188) occupying habitat fragments or islands varying greatly in size and age. The model encapsulates previous approaches based on diversity-dependent (DD) extinction rates while allowing for a more ﬂexible treatment of temporal dynamics. Three important results emerge. First, species loss rate slows down with the age of the isolate, a strong and general pattern largely unnoticed so far. Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms. Thirdly, a simple diversity-independent model based on area (converted into population size) and age explains 97% of the variability in species loss rate and appears to be a promising predictive tool to handle extinction debt following habitat loss.

AB  - The large losses of heathland area since the end of the 18th century can be expected to have resulted in the decline or even extinction of many characteristic heathland species. Historical data on plant species distribution patterns can provide valuable information in this context. Therefore, the aims of this research are to study how the loss of heathland area has changed the presence of heathland and forest plant species in north-western Belgium using historical plant distribution data, and to test whether the heathland ﬂora shows an extinction debt. Furthermore, plant traits determining extinction sensitivity are investigated.

AB  - Habitat loss leads to species extinctions, both immediately and over the long term as ‘extinction debt’ is repaid. The same quantity of habitat can be lost in different spatial patterns with varying habitat fragmentation. How this translates to species loss remains an open problem requiring an understanding of the interplay between community dynamics and habitat structure across temporal and spatial scales. Here we develop formulas that characterise extinction debt in a spatial neutral model after habitat loss and fragmentation. Central to our formulas are two new metrics, which depend on properties of the taxa and landscape: ‘effective area’, measuring the remaining number of individuals and ‘effective connectivity’, measuring individuals’ ability to disperse through fragmented habitat. This formalises the conventional wisdom that habitat area and habitat connectivity are the two critical requirements for long-term preservation of biodiversity. Our approach suggests that mechanistic fragmentation metrics help resolve debates about fragmentation and species loss.

AU  - Chen, Ling-ling

T2  - Mathematical Biosciences
AB  - Habitat destruction, often caused by anthropogenic disturbance, can lead to the extinction of species at an unprecedented rate. It is important, therefore, to consider habitat destruction when assessing population viability. Another factor often ignored in population viability analysis, is the Allee effect that adds to the risk of populations already on the verge of extinction. Understanding the Allee effect on species dynamics and response to habitat destruction has intrinsic value in conservation prioritization. Here, the Allee effect was considered in a multi-species hierarchical competition model. Results showed that species persistence declines dramatically due to the Allee effect, and certain species become more susceptible to habitat destruction than others. Two extinction orders emerged under habitat destruction: either the best competitor becomes extinct ﬁrst or the best colonizer ﬁrst. The extinction debt and order, as well as the time lag between habitat destruction and species extinction, were found to be determined by species abundance and the intensity of the Allee effect.

AB  - Following habitat fragmentation individual habitat patches may lose species over time as they pay off their ‘‘extinction debt.’’ Species with relatively low rates of population extinction and colonization (‘‘slow’’ species) may maintain extinction debts for particularly prolonged periods, but few data are available to test this prediction. We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land-use history from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, to test for an extinction debt in relation to species-speciﬁc extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presence–absence of 36 plant species were ﬁrst parameterized using data from Lincolnshire, where forest cover has been relatively low (ϳ5–8%) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory, for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in VlaamsBrabant, where forest cover was reduced from ϳ25% to Ͻ10% between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5%). As a consequence, the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus, more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover.

AB  - The destruction of natural habitats for agricultural production results in local biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss in turn aﬀects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forwardlooking policies for the long-term sustainability of human–nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win eﬀects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of eﬃcient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics.

AB  - Aim Biodiversity responses to changing environmental forcing on species are often characterized by considerable time-lags (= relaxation times). Although changes to the occurrence and abundance of species likely have cascading effects (e.g. on species of other trophic levels, genes, community structure and ecosystem processes), current concepts addressing lagged biodiversity responses are limited to single drivers affecting a few biodiversity components (e.g. extinction debt in terms of species numbers or population size). Little attention has been paid to the interacting and cumulative nature of time-lag phenomena. Here, we synthesize current knowledge, mechanisms and implications of delayed biodiversity responses and propose a ‘cumulative biodiversity lagsframework’ which aims to integrate lagged responses of various components of biological organization.

T2  - Global Change Biology
AB  - Understanding biodiversity changes in the Anthropocene (e.g. due to climate and land-use change) is an urgent ecological issue. This important task is challenging because global change effects and species responses are dependent on the spatial scales considered. Furthermore, responses are often not immediate. However, both scale and time delay issues can be tackled when, at each study site, we consider dynamics in both observed and dark diversity. Dark diversity includes those species in the region that can potentially establish and thrive in the local sites’ conditions but are currently locally absent. Effectively, dark diversity connects biodiversity at the study site to the regional scales and defines the site-specific species pool (observed and dark diversity together). With dark diversity, it is possible to decompose species gains and losses into two space-related components: one associated with local dynamics (species moving from observed to dark diversity and vice versa) and another related to gains and losses of site-specific species pool (species moving to and from the pool after regional immigration, regional extinction or change in local ecological conditions). Extinction debt and immigration credit are useful to understand dynamics in observed diversity, but delays might happen in species pool changes as well. In this opinion piece we suggest that considering both observed and dark diversity and their temporal dynamics provides a deeper understanding of biodiversity changes. Considering both observed and dark diversity creates opportunities to improve conservation by allowing to identify species that are likely to go regionally extinct as well as foreseeing which of the species that newly arrive to the region are more likely to colonize local sites. Finally, by considering temporal lags and species gains and losses in observed and dark diversity, we combine phenomena at both spatial and temporal scales, providing a novel tool to examine biodiversity change in the Anthropocene.

AU  - Gijbels, Pieter

T2  - Écoscience
AB  - Habitat restoration comprises the re-creation of suitable environmental conditions with the intention of recolonization by certain target species. In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management. Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit, whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland fragmentation, and with particular species’ life history traits. Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization. This may suggest that restoring the pollinator community is an important bottleneck in calcareous grassland restoration.

AB  - We developed a time-dependent stochastic neutral model for predicting diverse temporal trajectories of biodiversity change in response to ecological disturbance (i.e. habitat destruction) and dispersal dynamic (i.e. emigration and immigration). The model is general and predicts how transition behaviours of extinction may accumulate according to a different combination of random drift, immigration rate, emigration rate and the degree of habitat destruction. We show that immigration, emigration, the areal size of the destroyed habitat and initial species abundance distribution (SAD) can impact the total biodiversity loss in an intact local area. Among these, the SAD plays the most deterministic role, as it directly determines the initial species richness in the local target area. By contrast, immigration was found to slow down total biodiversity loss and can drive the emergence of species credits (i.e. a gain of species) over time. However, the emigration process would increase the extinction risk of species and accelerate biodiversity loss. Finally but notably, we found that a shift in the emigration rate after a habitat destruction event may be a new mechanism to generate species credits.

              Landscape structure is a major driver of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, the response of biodiversity can be delayed after landscape changes. This study aimed to determine the effect of current and past landscape structure on plant and bird assemblages. We used a trait-based approach to understand their responses to landscape simplification and habitat fragmentation. We quantified landscape structure at three different years (1963, 1985, 2000) and sampled current plant and bird assemblages in twenty 1 km
              2
              landscape windows located along the Seine Valley (France). For each window, we calculated plant and bird species richness, Community Weighted Variance (CWV), and Community Weighted Mean (CWM) of five functional traits related to dispersal capacity, reproduction, and life-cycle. We detected non-random patterns of traits for both taxa. Plant and bird species richness was lower in simple landscapes. The functional variance of plant traits was higher in landscapes simple in configuration. Both plant and bird assemblages strongly responded to past landscapes, especially their traits related to reproduction and life-cycle. It suggests that landscapes of the Seine valley will face a functional extinction debt. Further research is needed to better predict the delayed response of biodiversity expected to occur after landscape structure changes.

AU  - Montgomery, Fielding

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Declines in North American freshwater biodiversity can be largely attributed to anthropogenic disturbances that reduce habitat quantity, quality, and connectivity. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, wetlands have been significantly lost as a result of agricultural land-use practice, yet high species richness and several at-risk fishes persist. These patterns lead to the hypothesis that Great Lakes wetland fishes are in extinction debt, meaning there is a time lag between habitat loss and local extinction. To test this hypothesis, we sampled current species richness of wetland-specialist fishes in protected and unprotected wetlands in the Lake Erie basin. We predicted species richness in unprotected wetlands using parameter estimates (slope and intercept) from protected wetlands. Extinction debt was measured as a positive difference between predicted and observed species richness. We determined how much area would be required to support current species richness and compared this to minimum-area requirements for eight at-risk fishes. Species richness was significantly higher than predicted in unprotected wetlands, indicating that fishes in them are in extinction debt. This result indicates that there is time available to restore disturbed wetlands and prevent local extinction. We identified 17 wetlands of high priority for restoration (> 10 species bound for extinction) and determined that the restoration of 178 km2 of wetland habitat would reduce the risk of future biodiversity loss. This is the first direct study of extinction debt in freshwater fishes. Additional extinction-debt assessments in aquatic systems are needed to extend the ecological theory and fundamental application of extinction debt beyond terrestrial systems.

AB  - Aim Species are lost world-wide because of habitat destruction and fragmentation. Impacted communities can exhibit transient dynamics in response to such environmental changes, where slow extinctions and immigration delay the arrival to a new equilibrium. Life history traits such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt, but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs for vascular plants and three insect taxa.

            Mountain plant species shift their elevational ranges in response to climate change. However, to what degree these shifts lag behind current climate change, and to what extent delayed extinctions and colonizations contribute to these shifts, are under debate. Here, we calculate extinction debt and colonization credit of 135 species from the European Alps by comparing species distribution models with 1576 re-surveyed plots. We find extinction debt in 60% and colonization credit in 38% of the species, and at least one of the two in 93%. This suggests that the realized niche of very few of the 135 species fully tracks climate change. As expected, extinction debts occur below and colonization credits occur above the optimum elevation of species. Colonization credits are more frequent in warmth-demanding species from lower elevations with lower dispersal capability, and extinction debts are more frequent in cold-adapted species from the highest elevations. Local extinctions hence appear to be already pending for those species which have the least opportunity to escape climate warming.

AU  - Lalechère, Etienne

T2  - Population Ecology
AB  - Habitat turnover concomitantly causes destruction and creation of habitat patches. Following such a perturbation, metapopulations harbor either an extinction debt or an immigration credit, that is the future decrease or increase in population numbers due to this disturbance. Extinction debt and immigration credit are rarely considered simultaneously and disentangled from the relaxation time (time to new equilibrium). In this contribution, we test the relative importance of two potential drivers of time-delayed metapopulation dynamics: the spatial configuration of the habitat turnover and species dispersal ability. We provide a simulation-based investigation projecting metapopulation dynamics following habitat turnover in virtual landscapes. We consider two virtual species (a short-distance and a long-distance disperser) and five scenarios of habitat turnover depending on net habitat loss or gain and habitat aggregation. Our analyses reveal that (a) the main determinant of the magnitude of the extinction debt or immigration credit is the net change in total habitat area, followed by species dispersal distance and finally by the post-turnover habitat aggregation; (b) relaxation time weakly depends on the magnitude of the immigration credit or of the extinction debt; (c) the main determinant of relaxation time is dispersal distance followed by the net change in total habitat area and finally by the post-turnover habitat aggregation. These results shed light on the relative importance of dispersal ability and habitat turnover spatial structure on the components of time-delayed metapopulation dynamics.

AU  - Naaf, Tobias
AU  - Kolk, Jens
T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - In many temperate regions worldwide, a large portion of deciduous forest grows on former agricultural land, while a smaller portion is ‘ancient’ forest on sites with no historical record of agricultural land use. The differences in species diversity between ancient and post-agricultural forests have been well documented. However, in regions where forest fragmentation occurred only a few centuries ago, it remains unclear whether these differences are due to an extinction debt in ancient forests (i.e., a delay in local species extinction), a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests (i.e., species are yet to colonize a patch), or both. Additionally, our knowledge on how soil conditions and landscape conﬁguration interact with species’ traits to determine the colonization credit is limited. Here, we surveyed ancient and post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany to quantify the magnitude of the colonization credit and identify its determinants. The colonization credit in an average forest patch amounted to 4.7 forest specialist species and ranged up to 9 species in highly isolated patches. In contrast, we found more species than predicted in patches better connected to ancient forests. The colonization credit was not smaller in older patches than it was in younger ones. Species with a low dispersal potential and a low seed output contributed most to the colonization credit. Our study demonstrates that in a landscape where the extinction debt has already been paid and only a small fraction of ancient forest is left, the recovery of forest specialist diversity in post-agricultural forests may take several centuries.

TI  - Predicting extinction debt from community patterns
AU  - Kitzes, Justin
AU  - Harte, John
T2  - Ecology
AB  - A signiﬁcant challenge in both measuring and predicting species extinction rates at global and local scales is the possibility of extinction debt, time-delayed extinctions that occur gradually following an initial impact. Here we examine how relative abundance distributions and spatial aggregation combine to inﬂuence the likely magnitude of future extinction debt following habitat loss or climate-driven range contraction. Our analysis is based on several fundamental premises regarding abundance distributions, most importantly that species abundances immediately following habitat loss are a sample from an initial relative abundance distribution and that the long-term, steady-state form of the species abundance distribution is a property of the biology of a community and not of area. Under these two hypotheses, the results show that communities following canonical lognormal and broken-stick abundance distributions are prone to exhibit extinction debt, especially when species exhibit low spatial aggregation. Conversely, communities following a logseries distribution with a constant Fisher’s a parameter never demonstrate extinction debt and often show an ‘‘immigration credit,’’ in which species richness rises in the long term following an initial decrease. An illustration of these ﬁndings in 25 biodiversity hotspots suggests a negligible immediate extinction rate for bird communities and eventual extinction debts of 30–50% of initial species richness, whereas plant communities are predicted to immediately lose 5–15% of species without subsequent extinction debt. These results shed light on the basic determinants of extinction debt and provide initial indications of the magnitude of likely debts in landscapes where few empirical data are available.

AU  - Gibbs, David A.

T2  - Basic and Applied Ecology
AB  - Climate change is predicted to contribute to the present wave of extinctions; however, these extinctions may not immediately follow temperature increases and other climate change effects. We examined how predator species composition and increased temperatures affected bacterivorous protist community extinction debt (the number of species that will go extinct) and relaxation time (the amount of time it takes for the extinction debt to be paid off). We found that neither affected relaxation time, but that the presence of a generalist predatory protist species increased extinction debt through its role as a keystone predator. Warming also signiﬁcantly decreased how long it took communities to lose half of the species that were to eventually go extinct. That this half-relaxation time was shorter in warmed communities than in unwarmed communities in this system indicates that extinctions were front-loaded in the warmed communities compared to the unwarmed communities. Our ﬁndings suggest that even if increased temperature is not expected to increase extinction debt, it could still accelerate the rate at which those extinctions will occur. This in turn narrows the time window for taking actions to prevent a large portion of the extinction debt from being paid off.

TI  - Do imperfects trrade-offs affect the extinction debt phenomenon?
AU  - Banks, John E.
T2  - Ecology
AB  - A tight trade-off between competitive and colonization abilities is a key assumption of so-called ‘‘extinction debt models.’’ This trade-off implies that species ranked high in competitive ability will be ranked low with respect to dispersal. Although such a strict trade-off is plausible as a general trend, there are many examples in nature of deviations from perfect trade-offs. To determine how robust the ‘‘extinction debt’’ phenomenon is to imperfect trade-off relationships, I reexamined the extinction debt model of Tilman et al. in light of imperfect trade-offs. Numerically solving a system of differential equations, I found that, although the extinction debt phenomenon is not eliminated by the presence of imperfect trade-offs, the loss of species occurs earlier (with less habitat destruction) and more linearly than with perfect trade-offs.

AB  - The loss, fragmentation and degradation of native vegetation are major causes of loss of biodiversity globally. Extinction debt is the term used to describe the ongoing loss of species from fragmented landscapes long after the original loss and fragmentation of habitat. However, losses may also result from habitat changes that are unrelated to fragmentation, which reduce breeding success and recruitment. Many woodland birds have declined in fragmented landscapes in Australia, probably due to loss of small, isolated populations, though the ecological processes are poorly understood. We record the progressive regional loss of two ground-foraging, woodland birds, the Brown Treecreeper Climacteris picumnus and Hooded Robin Melanodryas cucullata, in northern New South Wales, over 30 years. This has happened despite most habitat loss occurring over 100 years ago, suggesting the payment of an extinction debt. Our observations suggest that several ecological processes, caused by habitat loss, fragmentation or degradation, and operating over different time scales, have led to both species’ declines. Female Brown Treecreepers disperse poorly among vegetation remnants, leaving only males in isolated populations, which then go extinct. In contrast, Hooded Robins suffer high nest predation in fragmented landscapes, producing too few recruits to replace adult mortality. Foraging by both species may also be affected by regrowth of ground vegetation and shrubs. We found little support for a major role played by drought, climate change or aggressive Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala. We propose that both extinction debt in the classical sense and ongoing habitat change frequently contribute to species’ decline in modiﬁed landscapes. Management to arrest and reverse such declines needs to consider these multiple causes of decline. For instance, reconnecting isolated populations may be inadequate alone, and activities such as appropriate grazing, ﬁres and the addition of woody debris may also be required.

TI  - Extinction debt: origins, developments, and applications of a biogeographical trope
AU  - Malanson, George P.
T2  - Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment
AB  - The concept of the extinction debt has two components: a direct timelag between an environmental perturbation and the consequent extinction of a species and the idea that among species going extinct the strong competitors/weak colonizers go extinct ﬁrst. Although the term was ﬁrst used in 1994 in the context of metapopulation models, its roots go back to general systems theory and the theory of island biogeography. It has been qualiﬁed and elaborated since 1994, mostly in terms of the effects of spatial pattern on the outcomes. The strongest critiques of the concept emphasize that the direct trade-off between competition and colonization abilities is not simple. The original application was to remnant habitat patches, but it could be applied to spatially heterogeneous habitats that are subject to climate change or invasive species. As a guide to conservation practice, extinction debt remains a general cautionary principle rather than a speciﬁc prescription, but the raising of awareness is nevertheless signiﬁcant.

AB  - Fragmented tropical forests can be highly dynamic, with the spatial conﬁguration of forest patches changing through time. Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies limits our understanding of how patch dynamics affect biodiversity, especially when there is a time lag in species extinctions (extinction debt). We assessed how temporal changes in patch size, shape complexity and isolation affect populations of the Mexican howler monkey (Alouatta palliata mexicana), hypothesizing that we would ﬁnd an extinction debt in this relatively long-lived species. We assessed patch occupancy, subpopulation size and immature-to-female ratio in 39 forest patches from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, in both 2001 and 2013. To identify time-lag responses to habitat disturbance, we related demographic attributes in 2013 to patch metrics in 2001 and 2013 and tested whether primate subpopulations were better predicted by current or historical patch characteristics. We also assessed how changes in patch metrics affected each demographic attribute between 2001 and 2013. Patch size and shape complexity increased over time, whereas isolation decreased. These positive spatial changes were accompanied by a 1.6-fold increase in mean subpopulation size over the same period. In addition, occupancy and immature-to-female ratio were similarly related to patch attributes in both years, suggesting that there is no extinction debt. Our ﬁndings are ‘good news’, suggesting that forest recovery over a relatively short period can promote the recovery of this Critically Endangered taxon. They also highlight the importance of preventing forest loss and promoting forest regeneration in human-modiﬁed tropical landscapes.

TI  - Extinction debt in fragmented grasslands: paid or not?
AU  - Cousins, Sara A.O.
T2  - Journal of Vegetation Science
AB  - Fragmentation of grasslands and forests is considered a major threat to biodiversity. In the case of plants, the effect of fragmentation or landscape context is still unclear and published results are divergent. One explanation for this divergence is the slow response of long-lived plants, creating an extinction debt. However, this has not been empirically conﬁrmed. In this study, data were compiled from broad-scale studies of grasslands from throughout the world that relate plant diversity to fragmentation effects. Only seven studies from northern Europe, out of a total 61, gave any information on actual habitat fragmentation in time and space. In landscapes with 410% grassland remaining, present-day species richness was related to past landscape or habitat pattern. In landscapes with o10% grassland remaining, in contrast, plant species richness was more related to contemporary landscape or habitat pattern. Studies from landscapes with 410% grassland remaining supported the concept of an extinction debt, while studies from more fragmented landscapes did not provide any evidence of an extinction debt. In order to make generalisations about historical legacies on species diversity in grasslands it is important to consider a range of highly transformed landscapes, and not only landscapes with a high amount of grassland remaining.

TI  - Extinction debt repayment via timely habitat restoration
AU  - Meyer, Katherine
T2  - Theoretical Ecology
AB  - Habitat destruction threatens the viability of many populations, but its full consequences can take considerable time to unfold. Much of the discourse surrounding extinction debts—the number of species that persist transiently following habitat loss, despite being headed for extinction—frames ultimate population crashes as the means of settling the debt. However, slow population decline also opens an opportunity to repay the debt by restoring habitat. The timing necessary for such habitat restoration to rescue a population from extinction has not been well studied. Here, we determine habitat restoration deadlines for a spatially implicit Levins/Tilman population model modified by an Allee effect. We find that restoration deadlines depend nonlinearly on initial, temporary, and final habitat destruction values. Conditions that hinder detection of an extinction debt also provide forgiving restoration timeframes. Our results highlight the importance of transient dynamics in restoration and suggest the beginnings of an analytic theory to understand outcomes of temporary press perturbations in a broad class of ecological systems.

AB  - Methods: We characterized habitat preferences for all endemic species of several taxonomic groups (vascular plants, ground and darkling beetles, flies and land snails). Using generalized linear mixed models and available data about habitat distributions, we tested for all taxa and habitat types to determine whether past habitat area better explained current richness of habitat specialists than current habitat area. If so, an extinction debt can be assumed.
Results: For all five major habitat types and five taxonomic groups studied, present-­ day richness of habitat specialists fitted better with past than current habitat area, evidencing habitat-­and taxon-­specific extinction debts. This pattern was consistent for both long-­lived vascular plants and short-­lived invertebrates. Single island endemics in each taxonomic group showed steeper slopes of the species–area relationship (SAR) compared to archipelago endemics indicating higher sensitivity to habitat loss which might increase sizes of ED.
Conclusion: Despite differences in species’ generation times, plants and invertebrates showed delayed extinctions after habitat destruction in the Canary Islands. Our SAR approach suggests that a considerable number of Canary Island endemics will eventually become extinct in the future without further habitat loss. The case of the Canary archipelago is probably not unique. Hence, we interpret our results as a warning for island conservationists that the worst of the extinction crisis on oceanic islands might be yet to come. Conservation actions should focus on habitat restoration to attenuate or reverse current extinction processes.

AB  - Aim: Local extinction after habitat modifications is often delayed, leading to an extinction debt. Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-­ mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate.

AB  - Plant species richness in central and northern European seminatural grasslands is often more closely linked to past than present habitat conﬁguration, which is indicative of an extinction debt. In this study, we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be found in clear-cuts after at least 80 years as coniferous production forest by comparing ﬂoras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits reﬂecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land use. Clearcuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36% higher species richness and 35% higher richness of grassland indicator species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory, compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction debts of the ﬂora, these young forests offer opportunities for grassland restoration at large scales. Our study supports the concept of remnant populations and highlights the importance of considering historical land use for understanding the distribution of grassland plant species in fragmented landscapes, as well as for policy-making and conservation.

Grasslands cover large areas of many countries, provide high levels of provisioning ecosystem services and are an important habitat for many species. While grasslands are often anthropogenic in nature, human-induced environmental perturbations are acknowledged threats to their biodiversity and functioning. Using a repeat survey of grassland plots in Scotland, UK we identiﬁed long-term changes in community composition and species indices over a 40 year period (1973–2013).

AB  - In an increasingly modified world, understanding and predicting the consequences of landscape alteration on biodiversity is a challenge for ecologists. To this end, metacommunity theory has developed to better understand the complexity of local and regional interactions that occur across larger landscapes. While metacommunity ecology has now provided several alternative models of species coexistence at different spatial scales, predictions regarding the consequences of landscape alteration have been done exclusively for the competition-colonization trade off model (CC). In this paper we investigate the effects of landscape perturbation on source-sink metacommunities. We show that habitat destruction perturbs the equilibria among species competitive effects within the metacommunity, driving both direct extinctions and an indirect extinction debt. As in CC models, we found a time lag for extinction following habitat destruction that varied in length depending upon the relative importance of direct and indirect effects. However, in contrast to CC models, we found that the less competitive species are more affected by habitat destruction. The best competitors can sometimes even be positively affected by habitat destruction, which corresponds well with the results of field studies. Our results are complementary to those results found in CC models of metacommunity dynamics. From a conservation perspective, our results illustrate that landscape alteration jeopardizes species coexistence in patchy landscapes through complex indirect effects and delayed extinctions patterns.

TI  - Herb layer extinction debt in highly fragmented temperate forests – Completely paid after 160 years?
AU  - Kolk, Jens

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - The time-delayed extinction of plant species following habitat fragmentation is a well-known phenomenon in ecology. The length of the relaxation time until this ‘extinction debt’ is paid (i.e., until extinctions cease) depends on the ecosystem, species group and extent of fragmentation. Studies of grassland ecosystems have revealed that plant extirpations after fragmentation can occur rapidly when the degree of fragmentation is high. Studies of extinction debt in highly fragmented forests, however, are lacking. In this study, we evaluated the existence of an extinction debt in the Prignitz, Brandenburg, Germany, where 94% of the semi-natural forests have vanished since 1780. We surveyed the herb-layer species of 104 forest patches and ﬁtted species richness as a function of the historical and present-day patch conﬁgurations. Models including the present-day habitat area and connectivity explained the present day species richness better than models including historical patch-conﬁguration variables. There was no signiﬁcant effect of the historical habitat area on the present day species richness. However, the effect of historical patch connectivity on the richness of forest specialists with short-distance dispersal potential was signiﬁcant when excluding present-day habitat area from the models and habitat quality and heterogeneity were used as covariables. The extinction debt has largely been paid after approximately 160 years of relaxation time which contrasts with previous studies of temperate forests that have found extinction debts persisting 120–225 years after fragmentation. We demonstrate that extinction debts in temperate forests may be paid off more rapidly if the degree of fragmentation is high.

AU  - Adriaens, Dries

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Long transient times in response to decreasing habitat area and increasing isolation may cause the present plant species distribution to reﬂect the historical rather than the present landscape conﬁguration, resulting in a so-called extinction debt. To investigate how plant species richness is shaped by both present and historical landscape conﬁguration and local environmental conditions in fragmented calcareous grasslands, 64 sites in Southern Belgium were surveyed for their total species richness and environmental characteristics. Species were subdivided in specialist and generalist groups and the former were clustered into emergent groups (EGs) according to 16 relevant life-history traits. Four specialist emergent groups were derived: orchids, rosette species, annuals and half-rosette species. Both specialist and generalist species richness increased with present fragment area, while present fragment connectivity only affected the number of specialist species. This trend was maintained for most EGs, although habitat area was mostly more important than connectivity. All species groups responded to an insolation gradient, except EGs of rosette and annual species. Differential response to fragmentation among emergent groups could be interpreted in terms of dispersal and persistence traits. No relation between species richness and historical area or connectivity was found, making an extinction debt unlikely. Hence, present-day variation in plant species diversity seems to be no legacy of past landscape conﬁguration. Our results clearly indicate that plant species may be quickly lost in response to new fragmentation events. To restore plant diversity, management should focus both on mitigating landscape fragmentation and restoring habitat quality.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - The biodiversity in calcareous grasslands suﬀered from severe habitat loss due to land-use intensiﬁcation and abandonment across Europe. Although these grasslands are now protected under the EU Habitats Directive, many species in the remaining habitat patches are still declining. Recent studies suggest that species across diﬀerent taxa may become extinct with a substantial time delay, even without further habitat loss. Consequently, there might be an extinction debt, which poses a major challenge for conservation. Here, we analysed the response of plant, grasshopper and butterﬂy species richness in calcareous grasslands to habitat fragmentation over the last ﬁve decades. In this study, habitat area and connectivity have undergone a marked decline between 1970 and 1990 but have only slightly declined during the last three decades. Despite this, the current richness of specialist and generalist species among plants and butterﬂies was equally or better explained by past than present landscape conditions. This ﬁnding indicates the existence of an extinction debt in both taxa in the still well-connected grasslands of the study area. We conclude that increased conservation measures since the 1990s have favoured species persistence, despite severe habitat loss in the more distant past. By contrast, grasshopper diversity weakly responded to habitat area and connectivity; rather it is likely to depend mainly on habitat quality. To inhibit future extinctions, it is crucial to maintain large-scale patches by traditional land-use practices (i.e. rough grazing or mowing once a year), as well as restore former habitat to facilitate species dispersal in fragmented landscapes.

AU  - Ellis, Christopher J.
AU  - Coppins, Brian J.
T2  - Diversity and Distributions
AB  - Axioms developed from island biogeography theory (i.e. species–area relationships, effects of fragmentation and isolation) are central to the development of conservation strategy. Within this context, the ‘extinction debt’ hypothesis brings into question an often assumed relationship between species richness and present-day spatial habitat structure (i.e. extent, fragmentation), suggesting instead that the richness and composition of biological communities may lag behind spatial changes in habitat. We examined evidence for an extinction debt among epiphytic lichens, a highly diverse biological group of signiﬁcant conservation concern. Using sites in Scotland, we compared epiphyte species richness in smaller-scale habitat units (aspen stands) to larger-scale woodland structure (extent and fragmentation) measured at two spatial scales (1 km2 and 4 km2) and for two timeframes, modern (1990s to 2000s) and historic (1860s to 1880s). Species richness was positively related to woodland extent and negatively related to woodland fragmentation; however, richness was explained better by historic woodland structure at a 1-km2 scale, than by modern woodland structure. The results indicate: (1) a coupling of stand-scale epiphyte assembly and dynamics of the wider woodland ecosystem, and (2) a signiﬁcant lag in the response of epiphyte species richness to habitat spatial structure. However, the effect of spatial habitat structure is different between species groups with contrasting traits. The effect of decreasing woodland extent on epiphyte richness is generally more severe for microlichens (comprising a greater number of rare and specialist species) than the more generalist macrolichens.

AB  - Methods: We re-surveyed species compositions in the 2000s in plots that had been surveyed in the 1980s, and estimated the impacts of the past (1910s) and recent (1980s–2000s) proportion of the total grassland area and the abovementioned factors on species dynamics during the past 20 yrs using hierarchical Bayesian models.
Results: In abandoned grasslands, the past grassland proportion was signiﬁcantly positively associated with the probabilities of survival of 96% of the grassland specialists and of colonization by 21% of these specialists. The effects of the past grassland proportion on the specialists were much stronger than those of recent grassland proportion and the other factors studied (i.e. herbivores, climate). In managed grasslands, however, the past grassland proportion had little effect on survival of and colonization by specialists from the result that few specialists were signiﬁcantly affected by past grassland proportion.
Conclusions: We found higher probabilities of both survival of and colonization by grassland specialists at sites with larger past habitat areas, which suggests that there is a time lag after habitat loss before the loss of specialists. In addition, we found that continuous management inhibits payment of the extinction debt created by the habitat loss.

AB  - Cities are expanding rapidly worldwide. Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterﬂy species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classiﬁed butterﬂy species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found signiﬁcant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more signiﬁcant impacts in small patches than in large ones. Extinction debt is an important concept for setting conservation priorities in highly fragmented landscapes, especially in urban areas.

AB  - A comprehensive view of population declines and their underlying causes is necessary to reverse species loss. Historically, in many cases, a narrow view may have allowed species declines to continue, virtually undetected, for long periods of time (perhaps even decades). We suggest that extinction debt is likely responsible for numerous (perhaps most) amphibian declines and that this perspective should be incorporated into the structure of amphibian research and management. Extinction debt, originally proposed to explain changes in species richness following environmental disturbance, also may refer to the proportion of populations of an individual species that is expected to eventually be lost because of habitat change. A conservation framework to address extinction debt focuses research on threats at the individual, population, and metapopulation levels. This approach will help enhance, restore, and protect speciﬁc processes and habitats at the proper scale by directing management to the most vulnerable level and stage of a species. We illustrate this approach using Flatwoods Salamanders, Ambystoma cingulatum and Ambystoma bishopi, which occurred historically throughout the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States but have experienced a greater than 85% loss of populations in recent years. Reversal of these losses is possible only if conservation and recovery efforts encompass individual, population, and metapopulation levels. We illustrate our framework by outlining actions that could be taken at each of these levels to help guide conservation and management of amphibians with complex life cycles and provide options for how to prioritize conservation actions in the face of logistical and budgetary shortfalls.

AB  - Many plants can persist in landscapes for a long time after focal habitats have disappeared or become fragmented, which might contribute to an extinction debt. Delayed responses of plant occurrence have recently received great attention, particularly in conservation, although evidence for extinction debts is incongruent. Here we asked if we could detect an extinction debt for plant species after 100 years of fragmentation, depending on regional or local (gamma or alpha respectively) diversity measure used, and if all plant species or only habitat specialists were investigated. Historical and contemporary grassland patterns were analysed in 33 rural landscapes (each 1 km2 in diameter) in south-eastern Sweden. Results show that managed semi-natural grassland had declined from 39% to 3% in 100 years. Diversity measured at regional scale was best explained by grassland extent 100 years ago, for both all species and grassland specialists. Present-day management, but neither present nor past grassland extent, was important for grassland specialists’ occurrence at the local scale, although present-day grassland proportion had a positive inﬂuence on species richness at the local scale. We found evidence of an extinction debt at both local and regional scale when all species were included in the analysis, but not for grassland specialist species at the local scale. However, the extinction debt is still to be settled for grassland specialists at the regional scale, and therefore the estimation of extinction debts in fragmented habitats presents one of the greatest challenges for conservation today and in the future.

TI  - Extinction debt of Hungarian reserves: A historical perspective
AU  - Báldi, András
AU  - Vörös, Judit
T2  - Basic and Applied Ecology
AB  - We compiled species lists of the birds, reptiles and amphibians found in Hungarian reserves, and then used these to estimate the level of historical species richness using species–area relationships. The situation in the 18th century, before largescale land transformation, such as river regulations and drainages, could be approximately reconstructed. The species–area relationship was signiﬁcant for all three classes. We estimated that 1 amphibian species, 4 reptile species, and 230 species of birds have become extinct in Hungary during the last two centuries. The latter seems unrealistic, so we evaluated extinctions in raptors (Falconiformes) which was the best known taxon. According to our estimation, there should be 23 extinct species of raptors in Hungary. However, we found only 14 potential species, even when considering unlikely species. Therefore, we conclude that the present species richness pattern in the reserves may have not reached equilibrium for several taxa (like birds), but probably has done so for others (amphibians and reptiles). Although, it would be desirable to extend the analysis to other taxa, this result indicates the existence of time-delayed species extinctions after habitat destruction, that is, an extinction debt. Currently, few studies have reported a timedelay effect from Europe. However, the results of this study suggest that an extinction debt may be important and should be considered when developing conservation strategies.

AB  - Sustainable urban nature conservation calls for a rethinking of conventional approaches. Traditionally, conservationists have not incorporated the history of the landscape in management strategies. This study shows that extant vegetation patterns are correlated to past landscapes indicating potential extinction debts. We calculated urban landscape measures for seven time periods (1938–2019) and correlated it to three vegetation sampling events (1995, 2012, 2019) using GLM models. We also tested whether urban vegetation was homogenizing. Our results indicated that urban vegetation in our study area is not currently homogenizing but that indigenous forb species richness is declining signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, long-term studies are essential as the time lags identiﬁed for diﬀerent vegetation sampling periods changed as well as the drivers best predicting these changes. Understanding these dynamics are critical to ensuring sustainable conservation of urban vegetation for future citizens.

AB  - Aim: For many species, the effects of landscape change can involve a time-­lag and result in an extinction debt. The landscape matrix plays a vital role in supporting species populations. However, the importance of the historical composition and configuration of landscape mosaics has received little attention, with studies focusing on the effects of loss and fragmentation of single (focal) habitat over time. We investigated the importance of historical and contemporary landscape heterogeneity (composition and configuration) to identify how landscape change has, and is continuing to have, an effect on current woodland carabid communities.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Large dams cause extensive inundation of habitats, with remaining terrestrial habitat conﬁned to highly fragmented archipelagos of land-bridge islands comprised of former hilltops. Isolation of biological communities on reservoir islands induces local extinctions and degradation of remnant communities. “Good practice” dam development guidelines propose using reservoir islands for species conservation, mitigating some of the detrimental impacts associated with ﬂooding terrestrial habitats. The degree of species retention on islands in the longterm, and hence, whether they are effective for conservation is currently unknown. Here, we quantitatively review species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands. We speciﬁcally investigate island species richness in comparison with neighbouring continuous habitat, and relationships between island species richness and island area, isolation time, and distance to mainland and to other islands. Species' responses to isolation on reservoir islands have been investigated in only 15 of the N58,000 large-dam reservoirs (dam height N 15m) operating globally. Research predominantly originates from wet tropical forest habitats and focuses on mammals, with species richness being the most widely-reported ecological metric. Terrestrial taxa are, overall, negatively impacted by isolation on reservoir islands. Reservoir island species richness declines with isolation time, and although the rate of loss is slower on larger islands, all islands exhibit depauperate species richness b 100 years after isolation, compared to continuous mainland habitats. Such a pattern of sustained and delayed species loss following largescale habitat disturbance is indicative of an extinction debt existing for reservoir island species: this pattern is evident across all taxonomic groups and dams studied. Thus, reservoir islands cannot reliably be used for species conservation as part of impact mitigation measures, and should instead be included in area calculations for land impacted by dam creation. Environmental licensing assessments as a precondition for future dam development should explicitly consider the long-term fate of island communities when assessing biodiversity loss vs energy output.

AU  - Highland, Steven A.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Fire suppression and climate change are leading to habitat fragmentation in temperate montane meadows across the globe, raising concerns about biodiversity loss. Restoration strategies may depend on the rate and nature of species response to habitat loss. We examined the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on plants and nocturnal moths in natural montane meadows in the western Cascades, Oregon, USA, using generalized additive mixed models, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and multiple response permutation procedure. Historic (1949) rather than current (2005) meadow size explained species richness of herbaceous plants and herb-feeding moths and meadow plant community structure, indicating that loss of meadow species may be delayed by many decades following loss of meadow habitat, resulting in an extinction debt. In contrast, abundance of herb-feeding moths and species richness and abundance of woody plantfeeding moths were related to recent meadow conﬁguration: as meadows are invaded by woody plants, abundance of meadow species declines, and woody plants and associated moths increase. Despite decades of ﬁre suppression and climate change, montane meadows in many temperate mountain landscapes may still be amenable to restoration.

AB  - Conservation policy requires reliable estimates of extinction rates that consider the interactions between population size (N) and habitat area. Current approaches to estimating extinction from the endemics–area relationship (EAR) estimate only the minimum number of species that can become extinct because of habitat loss (instantaneous extinction). EARs will therefore underestimate extinction if small populations and/or habitat area (SPHA) commit species to future extinction. We demonstrate this mathematically, by assuming species require a minimum population size of two individuals, and by randomly sampling habitat loss within stem-mapped forest plots. We then develop a general framework for incorporating SPHA effects into EARs that builds upon recent advances introducing N into estimates of extinction. By accounting for effects that modify N, our framework explains extinction debt and reduces the uncertainty associated with future estimates of extinction through carefully qualifying the spatial and temporal context of predictions.

AB  - Although there are many conservation and restoration obligations and targets, implementation thereof has so far been insufficient to halt or slow down biodiversity loss. In this context, efforts for ecological restoration must be accelerated. In fulfilling legal obligations and policy targets on restoration, it is important for lawyers and policy makers to understand the underlying ecological concepts. In this article three concepts, that are largely unknown in legal literature, are clarified, namely extinction debt, ecological trap and dark diversity. Their implications for law and policy are analysed and recommendations are made for better integration of these concepts into restoration projects. We recommend more efforts for monitoring beyond the simple presence of certain species, a higher ambition level for restoration measures, a substantial increase in measures for connectivity and restoration measures for ‘absent’ species.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has become a major concern of conservation because of negative influences on plant species declines and extinctions. However, local extinction of species can occur with a temporal delay following habitat fragmentation, which is termed extinction debt. Many studies about extinction debt rely on community equilibrium from relationships between species richness and habitat variables. We assumed that the distribution of many vascular plant species in the coastal range of south-central Chile is not in equilibrium with the present habitat distribution. The aim of this research is to quantify patterns of habitat loss and to detect extinction debt from relationships between the current richness of different assemblages of vascular plants (considering longevity and habitat specialization) and both past and current habitat variables. The results showed that native forests have been fragmented and reduced by 53%, with an annual deforestation rate of 1.99%, in the study area between 1979 and 2011. Current richness of plant species was mostly explained by past habitat area and connectivity. Past habitat variables explained best richness of long-lived specialist plants, which are characterized by restricted habitat specialization and slower population turnover. We also showed that habitat fragmentation has resulted in a significant reduction in long-lived plant species’ “dwelling patch sizes (DPS)” between 1979 and 2011. Our analyses provide the first evidence of predicted future losses of plant species in a South American temperate biodiversity hotspot. Consequently, an unknown proportion of the plants in the study area will become extinct if no targeted restoration and conservation action is taken in the near future.

T2  - Theoretical Ecology
AB  - Habitat degradation and destruction are the predominant drivers of population extinction, but there is little theory to guide the analysis of population viability in deteriorating environments. To address this gap, we investigated extinction times in time-varying, demographically stochastic versions of the logistic model for population dynamics. A property of these models is the Bextinction delay,^ a quantitative measure of the time lag in extinction created by speciesspecific extinction debt. For completeness, three models were constructed to represent the different demographic routes by which deterioration may affect population dynamics. Numerical analysis for two notional life histories indicated that the demographic response to environmental deterioration had a large effect on extinction delay, but a third analysis showed that the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity ultimately characterized its magnitude. A concave decline in carrying capacity produced a large extinction delay while a small delay occurred with a convex decline. Furthermore, our results explore the non-monotonicity of extinction debt with respect to the speed of deterioration. A peak is present at low levels of deterioration, and the height of the peak and the asymptote of delay are affected by both life history parameterizations and the rate of change of the carrying capacity. The results suggest that population viability analyses must consider not only environmental deterioration, but also the effects of deterioration on the trajectory of the decline in carrying capacity.

AB  - The spatio-temporal dynamics of wet heathlands from two landscapes in high Ardenne (Belgium), as well as the consequences of such dynamics on plant communities were investigated. Past and present destruction and origin of habitat patches have resulted in a complex network of different aged habitat patches. Current specialist and generalist species richness were assessed in 59 patches and analyzed with respect to present and past patch spatial metrics (controlled for habitat quality). Current patch area affected specialist species richness and current patch connectivity inﬂuenced both specialist and generalist species richness. Thirteen of the 59 patches were historical patches, i.e. patches that have remained since the 1770s. In these historical patches, including past landscape structure in the analysis explained more of the variability in current species richness than the current landscape structure alone, suggesting the existence of an extinction debt.

AB  - Habitat loss leads to species extinctions, both immediately and over the long term as ‘extinction debt’ is repaid. The same quantity of habitat can be lost in different spatial patterns with varying habitat fragmentation. How this translates to species loss remains an open problem requiring an understanding of the interplay between community dynamics and habitat structure across temporal and spatial scales. Here we develop formulas that characterise extinction debt in a spatial neutral model after habitat loss and fragmentation. Central to our formulas are two new metrics, which depend on properties of the taxa and landscape: ‘effective area’, measuring the remaining number of individuals and ‘effective connectivity’, measuring individuals’ ability to disperse through fragmented habitat. This formalises the conventional wisdom that habitat area and habitat connectivity are the two critical requirements for long-term preservation of biodiversity. Our approach suggests that mechanistic fragmentation metrics help resolve debates about fragmentation and species loss.

AB  - Aim Many species exhibit a time-lag between habitat loss and its extinction, resulting in extinction debt. Although extinction debt is considered a widespread phenomenon, differences in methodological approaches can affect its detection. We aim to contribute to this methodological debate by exploring whether extinction debt is either a phenomenon common to all patches or idiosyncratic to the patch and landscape attributes of a given patch. We also aim to determine whether the scale dependency of species richness might help to explain extinction debt.

T2  - Ecological Complexity
AB  - The mass-extinction events caused by human-driven habitat loss are a current concern in conservation science. However, the observed number of extinctions is considerably smaller than predicted. The overestimation of extinction rates comes from the time-delay which depends on the species sensitivity to habitat changes. The standard method of predicting the effect of habitat loss on biodiversity is to use the species–area relationship and progressively following it backwards to smaller areas. The difference between the actual number of species and the one provided by the backwards species–area relationship is dubbed extinction debt. Previous studies in general adopt a static view for the spatial distribution of species. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the problem urges us to adopt a dynamic framework to this issue since the time between disturbances of the landscape plays an active role in inﬂuencing the strength of the extinction debt. In this context, here we address two distinct approaches for this question: a static and a dynamic view of fragmentation. In the former we quantify the extinction debt in a quenched spatial distribution of species, whereas in the latter the community is let to evolve between disturbance events of the landscape. Here we show that the size of the extinction debt depends on the pattern of the fragmentation. It is found that random distributions of destroyed habitats provide larger extinction debts than those obtained for contiguous areas of fragmentation. Furthermore, in the dynamic approach it is observed that dispersal can lead to unexpected outcomes such as lower biodiversity levels than ones inferred from the backwards species–area relationship.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can be long-term processes driving extinction debts, especially in cities. Because of a lack of temporal data, long-term impacts are generally investigated less frequently than short-term impacts. However, these effects are equally important for understanding biodiversity loss. We developed a Bayesian Island Biogeography model combining historical imagery and current species distribution to investigate the long-term impacts of urbanization-induced habitat loss and isolation on birds. We surveyed 101 bird species in 43 urban forest patches in a South American city with different combinations of size, isolation, and time since the last abrupt change in area. Based on the current and historical landscape configuration, we estimated the temporal dynamics between species extinction rate and area, and between immigration rate and isolation. Additionally, we used model parameters to forecast bird extinction debts. Large patches had lower extinction rates than small patches, and immigration rates were lower in more isolated patches. Furthermore, current bird species richness was better explained by current landscape configuration than by past configuration, suggesting that birds rapidly respond to changes in urban landscapes and there are no apparent extinction debts. Indeed, we found that habitat loss reduces species diversity to a new equilibrium in relatively short period (less than 10 years), and model projections indicate that bird richness will remain similar to the present if patch area is maintained. Habitat loss is the most important cause of species local extinctions in urban areas, and tropical cities could rapidly promote biodiversity by restoring forest cover.

TI  - Predicting the Pattern of Decline of African Primate Diversity: an Extinction Debt from Historical Deforestation
AU  - Cowlishaw, Guy
T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Populations that have survived extensive habitat loss may still face extinction owing to a time lag between initial habitat loss and eventual population collapse. Using island biogeography theory, I investigated the potential existence and magnitude of such “extinction debts” among African forest primates as a result of historical deforestation. Forest primate species exhibited a classic species-area relationship (S ϭ cAz) with forest habitat across African countries. I conducted three tests based on the species-area relationship that indicate extinction debts are likely to exist in African forest primates; in particular, several national extinctions should have already occurred solely as a result of forest loss in the last 50 years (if extinctions occurred simultaneously with habitat loss), but none of these extinctions have yet taken place. I also used the speciesarea relationship to predict the number of species that make up the total debt accumulated since deforestation began in these countries. My results suggest that in most countries the debt currently consists of over 30% of the forest primate fauna, which usually constitutes between four and eight species. These figures are likely to be accurate because the same model predicts with a reasonable degree of precision (1) the severity of threat of extinction from deforestation faced by country endemics, (2) the distribution of regional community endemics threatened by deforestation, and (3) the total number of African species threatened by deforestation (according to the 1996 IUCN Red List). My findings indicate that although protected areas are an essential part of conservation, the protection of the remaining forest alone may not be enough to prevent extinctions caused by habitat loss.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Habitat loss often leads to a substantial decline in species richness. However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reﬂect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterﬂies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75 years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterﬂies (those not conﬁned to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterﬂies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern.

T2  - Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences
AB  - To make sense of our present biodiversity crises, the modern rate of species extinctions is commonly compared to a benchmark, or ‘background,’ rate derived from the fossil record. These estimates are critical for bounding the scale of modern diversity loss, but are yet to fully account for the fundamental structure of extinction rates through time. Namely, a substantial fraction of extinctions within the fossil record occurs within relatively short-lived extinction pulses, and not during intervals characterized by background rates of extinction. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to compare the modern event to these pulses than to the long-term average rate. Unfortunately, neither the duration of extinction pulses in the geological record nor the ultimate magnitude of the extinction pulse today is resolved, making assessments of their relative sizes difficult. In addition, the common metric used to compare current and past extinction rates does not correct for large differences in observation duration. Here, we propose a new predictive metric that may be used to ascertain the ultimate extent of the ongoing extinction threat, building on the observation that extinction magnitude in the marine fossil record is correlated to the magnitude of sedimentary turnover. Thus, we propose that the ultimate number of species destined for extinction today can be predicted by way of a quantitative appraisal of humanity's modification of ecosystems as recorded in sediments—that is, by comparing our future rock record with that of the past. The ubiquity of habitat disruption worldwide suggests that a profound mass extinction debt exists today, but one that might yet be averted by preserving and restoring ecosystems and their geological traces.

AB  - Methods We sampled 36 pollinator communities over a three-year period across cotton ﬁelds varying in historic and contemporary land-use. Using multiple regression on distance matrices (MRDM), we investigate correlations between community similarity and differences in contemporary and historic environmental factors.
Results First, we show that increased time between sampling events and the loss of semi-natural habitat over a 19-year period led to decreased community similarity. Interestingly, neither geographic distance nor contemporary environmental factors contributed to similarity. Second, we show that much of the variation in community similarity is due to variation in pollinator species life-history traits, such as foraging ability and diet breadth.
Conclusions Results indicate that land-use history has long-lasting effects on community composition, greater than effects exhibited by contemporary factors. These legacy effects are critical considerations for conservation as their omission may lead to overly optimistic assessments of biodiversity in recently disturbed habitats.

AB  - Biological indicator methods represent one of the most effective and widely used strategies for understanding the inﬂuences of environmental degradation on biodiversity in various landscapes. Researchers and land managers generally assume that the present distributions of biological indicator species are inﬂuenced by the current environment. However, recent studies have suggested the importance of past environments to species distributions (i.e., a time lag between changes in species distribution and habitat alterations). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the effects of past environments on the distributions of indicator species.

AB  - Methods: We used a data set collected previously comprising 45 vegetation plots with associated soil parameters, water table conditions and past land use. For each species we obtained the values or states for a set of plant functional traits: plant height, leaf dry matter content, speciﬁc leaf area, seed production, seed weight, life form and lateral expansion. To account for the effect of phylogeny, we evaluated trait diversity skewness by means of an ultrametric phylogenetic tree speciﬁcally constructed for the species studied. The association between both environmental gradients and past disturbance, and plant functional traits was tested by means of RLQ analysis.
Results: Of all the traits, only seed weight showed a phylogenetic signal; consequently, phylogeny was not included in the RLQ analysis. Conductivity was negatively correlated with seed weight, whereas water table conditions and soil ionic balance were negatively correlated with speciﬁc leaf area. Past disturbance was negatively correlated with leaf dry matter content and with lateral expansion.
Conclusions: Plant traits of Llobregat Delta coastal marsh communities are conditioned by environmental gradients and by past land use. Soil ionic balance and water table conditions determine key plant functional traits such as speciﬁc leaf area. This ﬁnding also corroborates the importance of soil ionic balance as a plant life driver in microtidal Mediterranean marshes. The effect of past land use on species traits might, however, be partially indirect and mediated by associated environmental changes.

Influence of landscape variables; area, past and present grassland connectivity, present management on total species richness, density and abundance of 25 grassland specialists was analysed.
Results: Semi-natural grasslands (permanent unfertilised pastures or meadows formed by traditional agricultural methods) had declined from 60% 150 years ago to 5% today. There was a significant decline in species richness and density in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Total species richness was influenced by present management, size and connectivity to present and past grassland pattern. Landscape variables did not influence species density in grazed semi-natural grassland suggesting that maintained grazing management makes grassland patches independent of landscape context. The abundance of 16 grassland specialists was mainly influenced by management and to some extent also by landscape variables.
Conclusion: Although species richness pattern reflect management and to some extent landscape variables, the response of individual species may be idiosyncratic. The historical signal from past landscapes is weak on present-day species richness in highly transformed, agricultural landscapes. Generalizations of historical legacies on species diversity in grasslands should consider also highly transformed landscapes and not only landscapes with a high amount of diversity hotspots left.

TI  - Time-lagged response of carabid species richness and composition to past management practices and landscape context of semi-natural field margins
AU  - Alignier, Audrey

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Field margins are key features for the maintenance of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Little is known about the effects of management practices of old semi-natural ﬁeld margins, and their historical dimension regarding past management practices and landscape context is rarely considered. In this paper, the relative inﬂuence of recent and past management practices and landscape context (during the last ﬁve years) were assessed on the local biodiversity (species richness and composition) of carabid assemblages of ﬁeld margins in agricultural landscapes of northwestern France. The results showed that recent patterns of carabid species richness and composition were best explained by management practices and landscape context measured four or ﬁve years ago. It suggests the existence of a time lag in the response of carabid assemblages to past environmental conditions of ﬁeld margins. The relative contribution of past management practices and past landscape context varied depending on the spatial scale at which landscape context was taken into account. Carabid species richness was higher in grazed or sprayed ﬁeld margins probably due to increased heterogeneity in habitat conditions. Field margins surrounded by grasslands and crops harbored species associated with open habitats whilst forest species dominated ﬁeld margins surrounded by woodland. Landscape effect was higher at ﬁne spatial scale, within 50 m around ﬁeld margins. The present study highlights the importance of considering time-lagged responses of biodiversity when managing environment. It also suggests that old semi-natural ﬁeld margins should not be considered as undisturbed habitats but more as management units being part of farming activities in agricultural landscapes, as for arable ﬁelds.

AB  - Time-lagged responses of biological variables to landscape modiﬁcations are widely recognized, but rarely considered in ecological studies. In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000–2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning.

AU  - Cousins, Sara A.O.

AB  - Past semi-natural grassland extent is thought to have a major inﬂuence on contemporary species richness in rural landscapes. The loss of grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.

A2  - Bruun, Hans Henrik
AB  - Methods: We examined the effect of current and past landscape structures, habitat continuity and habitat conditions on species composition. We tested the importance of species traits for species response to the landscape structure.
Results: In addition to habitat conditions, species composition was determined by landscape structures in the past and at present, and the past landscape structure in each time period separately was equally important to the present landscape structure. Perennial species that are insect- or wind-pollinated, ﬂower over limited periods of time, are relatively tall, are dispersed by animals, are not ruderal, have low nutrient requirements and maintain competitive or partly stress-tolerant strategies were found to be restricted to continuous localities existing at least since 1973 or 1988 and to localities that are currently well interconnected. In contrast, short, self-pollinated, ruderal species prevail in currently less-connected localities.
Conclusions: The results indicate that knowledge of the past landscape structure is important for understanding the current species distribution, and that species traits can be used as useful predictors of species responses to the past landscape structure.

AB  - Methods: Twelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2–4 and 6–8 yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1 m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species’ frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time.
Results: A total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classiﬁed as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily conﬁned to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64% higher total species richness and 110% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of ﬁnding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of ﬁnding a forest species increased.
Conclusions: We concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the ﬂora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8 yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation. Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management while also acknowledging the potential conﬂicts between conservation and production. The results may pertain to other countries with similar land-use histories.

AB  - Tree retention on clear-cuts is a relatively new measure in forestry aimed at ‘lifeboating’ forest species during young seral periods. However, the eﬀectiveness of tree retention for maintaining biodiversity for more than a few years is still poorly known. We investigated lichen persistence in retained buﬀer strips along small streams after clear-cutting of the surrounding forest, and compared with clear-cuts and un-cut references. Speciﬁcally, we compared richness and frequency of red-listed/signal species, calicioids and pendulous species before clearcutting with 2.5 years and 16.5 years after clear-cutting, and also analysed their colonization-extinction dynamics over time. The results show that the richness of red-listed/signal species and calicioids in buﬀer strips had declined signiﬁcantly after 16.5 years, but not after 2.5 years, while frequency displayed a signiﬁcant difference already after 2.5 years. The richness of pendulous lichens remained relatively stable over time, but the frequency had declined signiﬁcantly after 16.5 years. In clear-cuts all groups declined more than in buﬀer-strips (~2–3.5 times more) and the main decline had occurred already after 2.5 years. References remained stable over time. The colonization-extinctions dynamics reﬂected the richness declines, with high early extinction in clearcuts and lower but late extinction in buﬀer-strips, and low (re)colonization. We conclude that retained buﬀer strips cannot maintain lichen richness over time due to time-lagged extinction, but they are clearly more effective than clear-cuts. Wider buﬀer strips could potentially reduce tree mortality and decrease lichen extinction. The large amounts of standing dead wood makes buﬀer strips potential future colonization targets.

AB  - Predicting biodiversity relaxation following a disturbance is of great importance to conservation biology. Recently-developed models of stochastic community assembly allow us to predict the evolution of communities on the basis of mechanistic processes at the level of individuals. The neutral model of biodiversity, in particular, has provided closed-form solutions for the relaxation of biodiversity in isolated communities (no immigration or speciation). Here, we extend these results by deriving a relaxation curve for a neutral community in which new species are introduced through the mechanism of random ﬁssion speciation (RFS). The solution provides simple closed-form expressions for the equilibrium species richness, the relaxation time and the species-individual curve, which are good approximation to the more complicated formulas existing for the same model. The derivation of the relaxation curve is based on the assumption of a broken-stick species-abundance distribution (SAD) as an initial community conﬁguration; yet for commonly observed SADs, the maximum deviation from the curve does not exceed 10%. Importantly, the solution conﬁrms theoretical results and observations showing that the relaxation time increases with community size and thus habitat area. Such simple and analytically tractable models can help crystallize our ideas on the leading factors aﬀecting biodiversity loss.

AB  - Methods: We used a comprehensive vegetation plot database (473 species in 1,429 plots). Species’ response to historical variables was tested with logistic regressions, and the relationship between plant traits and historical variables was analysed with RLQ and fourth-corner analyses.
Results: Among all studied species, 250 responded to forest temporal continuity, 208 to 1860 land use, and 246 to 1958 land use. Species associated with ancient forests were more frequently forest specialists or forest edge species, shade-tolerant and perennials, while species associated with recent and very recent forests were more frequently annuals, anemochorous and heliophilous species. Species exhibited different traits and ecological preferences according to the type of land use prior to forest: therophytes were more frequent on former arable land while chamaephytes were more frequent on former pasture. Trait responses to 1860 and 1958 land uses were globally consistent.
Conclusions: The effect of forest temporal continuity and past land use on forest understorey communities was consistent with other studies in northern Europe or northern America, which suggests that the same ecological processes apply in temperate lowland and Mediterranean regions. This study highlights a succession of plant communities in the long term and different trajectories of succession according to the type of former agricultural use.

Open canopy structure had been maintained by both natural-­and human-­induced disturbances. In the past two centuries, suppression of such disturbances, together with forestry intensification, has turned most lowland woodlands into closed-­canopy forests. We investigated the effect of increased canopy closure on veteran trees and several threatened beetles associated with them.

AB  - Conservation of rare and endangered species requires assessment of factors that inﬂuence the current habitat associations of a species and the role of past habitat degradation in limiting occupancy or abundance. The objective of our 2011–2014 study was to determine how habitat characteristics and wetland history can predict occupancy and abundance patterns of bog turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) at the fringe of their range in the southeastern United States. We used a hurdle model to examine occupancy and abundance patterns while addressing problems associated with zero‐inﬂated data. Occupancy patterns were weakly related to percent of the wetland containing emergent vegetation, whereas abundance patterns were predicted by the percent silt in the wetland substrate, percent forest cover, amount of habitat degradation, and recovery time since past habitat degradation. The eﬀect of historical habitat degradation on abundance rather than occupancy patterns has rarely been documented and its eﬀect is rarely studied in vertebrate populations. Identiﬁcation of predictors of occupancy and abundance patterns will aid discovery of new populations of bog turtles and improve management of occupied wetlands. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Aim Pollinators play an important role in ecosystem functioning, affecting also crop production. Their decline may hence lead to serious ecological and economic impacts, making it essential to understand the processes that drive pollinator shifts in space and time. Land-use changes are thought to be one of the most important drivers of pollinators’ loss, and there is increasing investment on pollinator-friendly landscape management. However, it is still unclear whether landscape history of a given region determines how pollinator communities respond to further landscape modiﬁcation.

AB  - A recent model indicating that good competitiors and abundant species face the greatest risk of extinction from habitat destruction is critically examined. The conclusions drawn from the model are shown to rely on a number of assumptions regarding the mechanism of species coexistence, the relationship between abundance and competitive ability, and spatial characteristics of habitat destruction. The generality of these assumptions is questioned. Of particular concern are the assumptions that good competitors are poor dispersers, and that good competitors are the most abundant species. Furthermore, we suggest that the spatial scale of metapopulation dynamics in the model may not be appropriate for representing impacts of habitat destrustion. Empirical evidence is discussed indicating the limited applicability of the model for describing effects of habitat destruction on risks of species extinctions. Examples from a number of fragmented systems demonstrate that poor competitors and rare species are vulnerable to habitat destruction.

AB  - Present day Australian landscapes are legacies of our colonial history, while future landscapes will be legacies of ecological processes and human impacts occurring today. This paper investigates the legacies of European settlement of Noosa Shire, South-east Queensland, with particular emphasis on the economic and political drivers and the resultant loss and fragmentation of Koala Phascolarctos cinereus habitat. Patterns of habitat loss between 1860 and 1970 were quantified at a coarse level from historical and land tenure records, while changes over the past 30 years were mapped at a finer spatial resolution from aerial photography and satellite imagery. Periods of high economic growth and to lesser extents depression are linked to increased vegetation clearing. Fifty per cent of P. cinereus habitat has been lost since 1860, with habitat class 2A (30-<50 per cent of preferred habitat trees) and 2C (10-<30 per cent of preferred habitat trees) suffering the highest proportion of loss. The period of greatest habitat loss was between 1890 and 1910, linked to the development of the dairy industry in the western half of Noosa Shire. A second significant phase of loss occurred since 1970, linked to the planting of exotic pine plantations, urbanisation and rural subdivision, with 35 per cent of remaining habitat being cleared, mainly in the southern part of the Shire.The cumulative loss of habitat has been accompanied by increasing levels of habitat fragmentation indicated by reduced patch size and increased patch linearity. Further analysis of the temporal aspects of habitat change is required in order to test the hypothesis that there is a relaxation period between the timing of habitat loss and current pattern of habitat occupancy of P. cinereus populations.

AB  - One of the major challenges in ecology is to predict how multiple global environmental changes will affect future ecosystem patterns (e.g. plant community composition) and processes (e.g. nutrient cycling). Here, we highlight arguments for the necessary inclusion of land-use legacies in this endeavour. Alterations in resources and conditions engendered by previous land use, together with inﬂuences on plant community processes such as dispersal, selection, drift and speciation, have steered communities and ecosystem functions onto trajectories of change. These trajectories may be modulated by contemporary environmental changes such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition. We performed a literature review which suggests that these potential interactions have rarely been investigated. This crucial oversight is potentially due to an assumption that knowledge of the contemporary state allows accurate projection into the future. Lessons from other complex dynamic systems, and the recent recognition of the importance of previous conditions in explaining contemporary and future ecosystem properties, demand the testing of this assumption. Vegetation resurvey databases across gradients of land use and environmental change, complemented by rigorous experiments, offer a means to test for interactions between land-use legacies and multiple environmental changes. Implementing these tests in the context of a trait-based framework will allow biologists to synthesize compositional and functional ecosystem responses. This will further our understanding of the importance of land-use legacies in determining future ecosystem properties, and soundly inform conservation and restoration management actions.

TI  - Plant community assembly in suburban vacant lots depends on earthmoving legacy, habitat connectivity, and current mowing frequency
AU  - Tsuzuki, Yoichi

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - In suburban regions, vacant lots potentially offer significant opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Recently, in Japan, due to an economic recession, some previously developed lands have become vacant. Little is known, however, about the legacy of earlier earthmoving, which involves topsoil removal and ground leveling before residential construction, on plant community composition in such vacant lots. To understand (dis)assembly processes in vacant lots, we studied 24 grasslands in a suburban region in Japan: 12 grasslands that had experienced earthmoving and 12 that had not. We surveyed plant community composition and species richness, and clarified compositional turnover (replacement of species) and nestedness (nonrandom species loss) by distance-based β-diversities, which were summarized by PCoA analysis. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to examine the effects of soil properties, mowing frequency, past and present habitat connectivities on compositional changes. As a result, past earthmoving, mowing frequency, soil properties, and past habitat connectivity were found to be the drivers of compositional turnover. In particular, we found legacy effects of earthmoving: earthmoving promoted turnover from native grassland species to weeds in arable lands or roadside by altering soil properties. Mowing frequency also promoted the same turnover, implying that extensive rather than intensive mowing can modify the negative legacy effects and maintain grassland species. Decrease in present habitat connectivity marginally enhanced nonrandom loss of native grassland species (nestedness). Present habitat connectivity had a positive effect on species richness, highlighting the important roles of contemporary dispersal. Our study demonstrates that community assembly is a result of multiple processes differing in spatial and temporal scales. We suggest that extensive mowing at local scale, as well as giving a high conservation priority to grasslands with high habitat connectivity at regional scale, is the promising actions to maintain endangered native grassland species in suburban landscapes with negative legacy effects of earthmoving.

AB  - Species diversity may have time-lagged responses to landscape changes, but whether species are more strongly related to present or past landscape could vary with the taxa or functional traits. In this study, the eﬀects of present and past landscape structures on carabid and spider communities were investigated. We hypothesized that present landscape structure was more highly correlated to small, omnivorous or macropterous carabids and small or ground-hunting spiders, while past landscape structure was more highly correlated to large or predatory carabids and large spiders. We analyzed landscape data from 1955, 1977, 1984, 1993 and 2013 and species data from 1995 and 2013 within the suburb of Qianjiang, a city in China. We found that both past and present landscape metrics aﬀected present species richness in 1995 and species composition in 2013 due to the correlation between past and present landscape metrics. The time delay or immediate response of species was speciesspeciﬁc and not dependent on diﬀerent groups in relation to body size, wing morphology, dietary preference or foraging method. The stable landscape structure from 1984 to 1993 had the greatest impact on species richness in 1995. In addition, the semi-natural land without dramatic changes since 1977 signiﬁcantly aﬀected the carabid species diversity. In addition, the excessive increase in building lands from 1993 to 2013 also signiﬁcantly aﬀected species composition in 2013. Our studies suggested that both historical and present landscape structures, the magnitude of land use change and each species’ traits should be the focus of biodiversity conservation activities.

AB  - Many grasslands have disappeared over the last century as a result of anthropogenic land use intensification, while new patches are emerging through abandonment of arable fields. Here, we compared species (SD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) (alpha) diversity among 272 dry grassland patches of two age-classes: old and new, with the new patches being dry grasslands established on previous intensively managed fields during the last 30 years. We first compared SD, FD and PD, between patches of different age. Then, we performed generalized linear models to determine the influence of abiotic, present-day and historical landscape configuration variables on SD, FD and PD. By measuring abiotic variables, we explained the effect of environmental filtering on species diversity, whereas the present-day and historical landscape configuration variables were included to describe how the spatial and temporal configuration of the patches influence patterns of species. Finally, we applied partial regressions to explore the relative importance of abiotic, present-day and historical variables in explaining the diversity metrics and how this varies between patches of different ages. We found higher SD in the old compared to the new patches, but no changes in FD and PD. SD was mostly affected by abiotic and present-day landscape configuration variables in the new and the old patches, respectively. In the new patches, historical variables explained variation in the FD, while present-day variables explained the PD. In the old patches, historical variables accounted for most of the variation in both FD and PD.

TI  - Maggengo meadow patches enclosed by forests in the Italian Alps: evidence of landscape legacy on plant diversity
AU  - Sitzia, Tommaso
AU  - Trentanovi, Giovanni
T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - The maggenghi are mid slope meadows typical of all the southern and of great parts of the northern European Alps, for centuries managed with traditional and low intensity techniques. Usually, they are scattered patches in surrounding forests. The spontaneous expansion of trees and shrubs, favored by the recent decline of mountain agriculture, lead the maggengo patches patterns and shapes to change. Our objective was to analyze the effect of this change on current plant diversity of the remnant patches, as the adaptive response could be slow and possibly related more to historical than to current landscape patterns. We analyzed the trend of the size, shape, elongation, fractal dimension and connectivity of maggengo patches of a Central-Eastern Italian Alpine district, in four time steps, from 1973 to 2006, and in 1859, when mountain agriculture was still widespread. Then, we studied the relationships between those landscape metrics and two current patch-level plant diversity measures: interior species richness and species density. Aerial photographs were used to investigate that trend, while a historical cadastral map was used to assess the landscape metrics in 1859. As expected, in the last 30 years, the total size of maggenghi has been reduced by 57% while their shapes have been progressively simpliﬁed. Interior species richness was positively related to size, both in 2006 and over the past 30 years, but not to any 1859 measures. Conversely, species density was positively correlated only with 1859 size, shape index and connectivity. We conclude that the historical shape, size and connectivity are some of the key variables affecting the plant species density of maggengo patches, but not of their interior plant species richness.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes, plant species richness may depend not only on local habitat conditions but also on landscape structure. In addition, both present and past landscape structure may be important for species richness. There are, however, only a few studies that have investigated the relative importance of all of these factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of current and past landscape structures and habitat conditions on species richness at dry grassland-like forest openings in a forested landscape and to assess their relative importance for species richness. We analyzed information on past and present landscape structures using aerial photographs from 1938, 1973, 1988, 2000 and 2007. We calculated the area of each locality and its isolation in the present and in the past and the continuity of localities in GIS. At each locality, we recorded all vascular plant species (296 species in 110 forest openings) and information on abiotic conditions of the localities. We found that the current species richness of the forest openings was significantly determined by local habitat conditions as well as by landscape structure in the present and in the past. The highest species richness was observed on larger and more heterogeneous localities with rocks and shallow soils, which were already large and well connected to other localities in 1938. The changes in the landscape structure in the past can thus have strong effects on current species richness. Future studies attempting to understand determinants of species diversity in fragmented landscapes should also include data on past landscape structure, as it may in fact be more important than the present structure.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - The reformation of the Swedish agricultural system, about 150 years ago, drastically changed the use of semi-natural grasslands. Grassland plant diversity has declined due to abandonment, changed management methods and production intensiﬁcation. Current diversity patterns are thus a result of historical and current land use in combination. In this study we investigate the relative importance of historical grassland management and current land use for grassland plant diversity. The distribution of 128 grassland plant species in an agricultural landscape in southwest Sweden was analysed in relation to current land use and land use in three historical time periods; the 18th and the 19th century and around 1960. Land use during the three historical periods was also combined into land-use sequences. Four diversity estimates were used: number of grassland species, number of grassland specialists, Shannon–Wiener index on the specialists and total cover/hectare of specialists. Historical land use – especially 18th century and the land-use sequences – explained more of the variation among study sites than did current land use. Continuity of a speciﬁc management type was important for grassland plants as indicated by highest diversities being found in pastures continuously grazed since the 18th century. Former hay meadows, currently grazed, did not differ in any diversity estimate from abandoned hay meadows, indicating that change of management from mowing to grazing a century ago may cause diversity declines similar to abandonment some 40 years ago. Limited artiﬁcial fertilisation in the managed areas may have contributed to this effect. Further decline in grassland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape is expected because a substantial proportion of grassland plant populations occur in abandoned areas.

AB  - Loss of the area and connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats impose serious negative effects on all aspects of biodiversity. However, quantifying the effect of these pressures is difficult due to the time-lagged responses of biodiversity to landscape change. The aim of this study is to determine if genetic diversity of plant populations exhibits a delayed response to recent landscape change. Using microsatellite markers, we evaluated genetic diversity in 28 populations of a grassland plant Trifolium montanum in Estonian calcareous grasslands. We examined the response of genetic diversity to various current and historic landscape parameters assessed at two time points: (1) 2017, and (2) 1930, when the extent of grasslands in Estonia was at its maximum. Observed heterozygosity ­(HO) and inbreeding coefficients ­(FIS) were affected by historic grassland availability in the surroundings of the study populations (buffer radius of 2000 m). However, expected heterozygosity (­HE) responded positively to current grassland area and to the availability of grasslands in the surrounding landscape. Allelic richness ­(AR) was positively related to current population size. We found evidence for recent genetic bottlenecks in half of the study populations, indicating that landscape change had a negative impact on population demography and consequent genetic diversity. Our findings suggest that regardless of major habitat loss, some measures of genetic diversity of perennial plant species may not be at equilibrium with landscape change. This calls for caution when interpreting observed patterns of plant genetic diversity and requires consideration of historic landscape context when recommending nature conservation strategies.

AB  - Forest fragmentation impacts community structure at both local and regional scales over time. Understanding the resilience of tropical forests to anthropogenic impacts and the period for communities to recover are critical steps for conservation policy implementation. We took advantage of a dynamic group of land plants to study temporal changes in their community structure over a period of 15 years at a landscape-scale experimental fragmentation site in central Amazonia. We observed an overall increase in estimated epiphyll abundances and species richness in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha reserves) suggesting recovery rather than a belated accumulation of local extinction events. However, higher turnover in smaller fragments, when compared to larger ones, was driven by increased presence of core species indicating interspecific differences in survivability. These disproportionate changes in occupancy patterns and relative abundances in fragments were best explained by life history traits reflecting increased dispersal capacity and physiological tolerances suggesting recovery of the phyllosphere community in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha) over 15 years. Even for this group renowned for fast generation times and high reproductive output, epiphyll metacommunities of smaller fragments have yet to recover from local extinctions accrued following the initial fragmentation nearly 40 years ago. However, the interaction of dispersal capacities and physiological tolerances are playing a significant role in the recovery of their spatiotemporal distributional patterns in this experimentally fragmented landscape.

T2  - Biological Reviews
AB  - Habitat loss has pervasive and disruptive impacts on biodiversity in habitat remnants. The magnitude of the ecological impacts of habitat loss can be exacerbated by the spatial arrangement – or fragmentation – of remaining habitat. Fragmentation per se is a landscape-level phenomenon in which species that survive in habitat remnants are confronted with a modiﬁed environment of reduced area, increased isolation and novel ecological boundaries. The implications of this for individual organisms are many and varied, because species with diﬀering life history strategies are diﬀerentially aﬀected by habitat fragmentation. Here, we review the extensive literature on species responses to habitat fragmentation, and detail the numerous ways in which confounding factors have either masked the detection, or prevented the manifestation, of predicted fragmentation eﬀects.

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Variation in life-history strategies can affect metapopulation dynamics and consequently the composition and diversity of communities. However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000–5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000–8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.

AB  - In Europe, extensively managed grasslands have undergone large-scale declines due to intensive agriculture and abandonment. Their restoration supports arthropod biodiversity within farming systems. We investigated limiting factors for arthropod establishment during grassland restoration across a chronosequence of 52 resto­ ration sites established by either natural regenerating or direct seeding. Our study covered 363 arthropod species of 10 orders, including detritivores, herbivores, predators and pollinators. These were sampled using pitfall traps, suction sampling and transect walks. The similarity of plant communities on restoration sites to target species rich grasslands was positively correlated with the similarity of the arthropod communities to these same grasslands. There was evidence that restoration sites located in landscapes suffering from historic large-scale loss of species rich grassland (1930–2015) had lower success in replicating the composition of arthropod commu­ nities and supported the lowest levels of species richness. The age of the restoration site was a predictor of restoration success for some trophic levels. For example, predator species richness was greatest in the oldest restoration sites. However, this was only the case were sites were either of large size or located in landscapes with the lowest historic loss of species rich grassland. Impacts of within site management also affected arthropod communities. The annual frequency of cutting negatively affected detritivores species richness, and selected against traits including herbivore monophagy. Overall arthropod species richness was positively correlated with sward height. These results emphasise the relative importance of the success with which the floral community is replicated, as well as landscape and management factors, during grassland restoration. This has implications for future agri-environmental schemes. In particular, achieving high quality within-site management that maximises establishment of the plant communities needs to be the initial focus of any restoration program.

AU  - Lindborg, Regina

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Transformation of landscapes is considered to be one of the main drivers behind species loss, regionally and globally. Theory and empirical studies suggest that landscape structure inﬂuences species diversity in many habitats. These effects may be manifested at different spatial scales depending on species response to landscape heterogeneity. A similar, but often neglected, scaling issue concerns the temporal scale of species response to landscape change. In this study, we found time lags of 50–100 years in the response of plant species diversity to changing conﬁguration of habitats in the landscape. When analyzing remnants of traditionally managed seminatural grasslands in Sweden, we found that species diversity was not related to present-day connectivity of the investigated sites, irrespective of spatial scale (3.1–12.5 km2). However, when using maps depicting landscapes 50 and 100 years ago, respectively, strong positive effects of habitat connectivity appeared, at increasing spatial scale for the older landscapes. Thus, analyses of how species diversity relates to present-day landscapes may be misleading, and future species loss may be expected even if the present landscape is maintained.

AB  - Theory surrounding landscape ecology has been built on the species distribution of birds and plants, but increasing evidence now exists for below-ground organisms, whose dispersal may also be affected by above-ground landscape structures. Uncertainties remain for how communities of microorganisms respond to landscape structure over time, and whether some groups of microorganisms react more than others. Here, we investigated if fungal or bacterial diversity is driven by the amount of forest cover in the current or the past landscape. We tested the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH) on ancient forests of the Cevennes national park, that experienced increased fragmentation 150 years ago, and are today surrounded by recent forests. As ancient forests are often more diverse in plant species, we hypothesized that the higher quantity of ancient forests in the landscape, the richer local fungal and bacterial communities would be. More precisely, we expected that ectomycorrhizal fungi, and pathotrophic fungi, often indicators of mature forests, would be also more sensitive to forest history and therefore to the quantity of ancient forests than bacteria and saprotrophic fungi. We sampled 40 soil cores per 0.5 ha, pooled in 8 composite samples per plot in 27 landscapes and sequenced ITS1 and 16S markers by Illumina-Mi seq. To identify functional groups of fungi, we relied on their taxonomy and the use of public databases. Our results partly follow the HAH, as fungal richness was positively related with the quantity of ancient forests in the landscape and not by the focal patch size. Ectomycorrhizal and pathotrophic fungi were positively affected by the ancient forest cover, and so were saprotrophic ones, but not bacteria. Local factors also shaped the communities such as soil composition and elevation, conﬁrming classical patterns in soil microbial ecology. Interestingly, past landscape structure was better at explaining fungal community richness than contemporary landscape, suggesting a time lag in the response of communities to landscape modiﬁcation and a potential extinction debt. Our results reveal the importance of below-ground communities in studies of landscape and historical ecology, with their structure and functions likely to be intimately linked with soil and landscape history.

AB  - To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II. Ignoring time delays in population and metapopulation dynamics will lead to an underestimate of the number of effectively endangered species.

AB  - Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature dealing with the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity and obtained 32 studies.
Results We presented two main approaches based on graph theory and compared them from conceptual and operational perspectives. The ﬁrst widely used approach, accounting only for the spatial dispersal of organisms, quantiﬁes temporal changes in spatial connectivity. Based on two or multiple time steps in the time series, this approach enables assessment of the sense and magnitude of the temporal changes in spatial connectivity. The second recently developed approach quantiﬁes spatio-temporal connectivity, thus accounting for both spatial and temporal dispersal. So far, this holistic assessment of spatio-temporal connectivity only covers two time steps.
Conclusion Existing methods for the assessment of the temporal dynamics of connectivity provide indicators to advance our understanding of biodiversity patterns, and to be able to implement measures to conserve and restore connectivity. We propose future directions to develop these methods.

AB  - Intensiﬁcation or abandonment of agricultural land use has led to a severe decline of semi-natural habitats across Europe. This can cause immediate loss of species but also time-delayed extinctions, known as the extinction debt. In a pan-European study of 147 fragmented grassland remnants, we found differences in the extinction debt of species from different trophic levels. Present-day species richness of long-lived vascular plant specialists was better explained by past than current landscape patterns, indicating an extinction debt. In contrast, short-lived butterﬂy specialists showed no evidence for an extinction debt at a time scale of c. 40 years. Our results indicate that management strategies maintaining the status quo of fragmented habitats are insufficient, as timedelayed extinctions and associated co-extinctions will lead to further biodiversity loss in the future.

AB  - Models describing relationships between landscape features and species distribution patterns often display inter-study inconsistencies. Identifying factors contributing to these inconsistencies is a vital step in clarifying the ecological importance of landscape features and synthesizing an effective knowledge base for use in conservation contexts. We examined the inﬂuence of several spatial, temporal, and life history assumptions on the outcomes of distribution versus landscape models (DLMs) relating wetland bird communities at 29 Massachusetts (USA) sites to independent urbanization, wetland, forest, and agricultural landscape gradients. We considered a bird specialization index as well as obligate and facultative species richness as response variables. Landscape gradients were quantiﬁed at 10 landscape extents (0–1000 m in 100 m increments) and three time periods (1971, 1985, 2005). Univariate models indicated that our specialization index showed: (1) the strongest response to landscape gradients at small extents (200 m); (2) a negative, threshold response to urbanization was superior to a linear ﬁt; and (3) no evidence of time-lagged effects of landscape change.

AB  - A key question facing conservation biologists is whether declines in species’ distributions are keeping pace with landscape change, or whether current distributions overestimate probabilities of future persistence. We use metapopulations of the marsh fritillary butterﬂy Euphydryas aurinia in the United Kingdom as a model system to test for extinction debt in a declining species. We derive parameters for a metapopulation model (incidence function model, IFM) using information from a 625-km2 landscape where habitat patch occupancy, colonization, and extinction rates for E. aurinia depend on patch connectivity, area, and quality. We then show that habitat networks in six extant metapopulations in 16km2 squares were larger, had longer modeled persistence times (using IFM), and higher metapopulation capacity (kM) than six extinct metapopulations. However, there was a .99% chance that one or more of the six extant metapopulations would go extinct in 100 years in the absence of further habitat loss. For 11 out of 12 networks, minimum areas of habitat needed for 95% persistence of metapopulation simulations after 100 years ranged from 80 to 142 ha (;5–9% of land area), depending on the spatial location of habitat. The area of habitat exceeded the estimated minimum viable metapopulation size (MVM) in only two of the six extant metapopulations, and even then by only 20%. The remaining four extant networks were expected to suffer extinction in 15–126 years. MVM was consistently estimated as ;5% of land area based on a sensitivity analysis of IFM parameters and was reduced only marginally (to ;4%) by modeling the potential impact of long-distance colonization over wider landscapes. The results suggest a widespread extinction debt among extant metapopulations of a declining species, necessitating conservation management or reserve designation even in apparent strongholds. For threatened species, metapopulation modeling is a potential means to identify landscapes near to extinction thresholds, to which conservation measures can be targeted for the best chance of success.

AB  - Land-use change is a root cause of the extinction crisis, but links between habitat change and biodiversity loss are not fully understood. While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss versus fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985 to 2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by the past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss versus fragmentation studies.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Current occurrence patterns of species associated with ancient trees may reﬂect higher historical habitat densities, because the dynamics of the habitat and the colonisation-extinction processes for many inhabiting species are expected to be slow. We tested this hypothesis in southeast Sweden by analysing species occurrence per parish for twelve redlisted lichen species and nine redlisted fungus species in relation with current density of big oaks, the density of oaks in the 1830s and connectivity with parishes with the species present. For most species, the occurrence was positively related with current density of habitat (for 18 species out of 21) and parish area (for 16 species). Historical habitat density was positively related with occurrence for 11 species, while connectivity with current occurrences in the surroundings was positive for the occurrence of 12 species and negative for the occurrence of two. For lichen species the connectivity measure that best explained the variation was at a larger spatial scale as compared to fungus species. Even if the density of old oaks remains in the future, inhabiting species will most likely decline because their distribution patterns are not in equilibrium with the current habitat density. Therefore, to allow long-term persistence of inhabiting species the number of old oaks should be increased. Areas where such an increase is most urgent could be identiﬁed based on species occurrence data and current habitat density, but because species data will always be incomplete data on the historical habitat distribution is valuable.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems have been substantially altered, threatening the survival and recovery of aquatic species at risk. Estimating the likelihood and magnitude of future extinctions (extinction debt; ED) is integral for conserving biodiversity and requires accurate species composition lists. Using species-area relationships, we estimated ED for fishes in historically disturbed wetlands in the Lake Erie basin. Then, we used simulated data sets to assess how ED varied when species lists used to derive species-area relationships had an increasing proportion of undetected species. When species lists were incomplete, ranging from 0.99 to 0.75, 15% fewer wetlands were estimated to have species in ED and, on average, 50% fewer species were expected to go extinct per wetland. Imperfect detection ultimately biased conservation prioritization among wetlands. Our findings suggest that if imperfect detection is not accounted for when projecting future extinctions, the severity of future species loss across a landscape, and the subsequent need for immediate restorative action, can be greatly underestimated.

AB  - Agricultural intensiﬁcation has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterﬂies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterﬂy species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870–1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterﬂies as well.

AB  - Forests play a key role in climate change mitigation, adaptation and delivery of a range of ecosystem services. There is increasing evidence for impacts of climate and other drivers on plant community change, and fragmented habitats are predicted to be much less resilient to negative impacts on biodiversity and other services. Within Europe, Scotland's native forests are highly fragmented and now cover 4% of the land after many centuries of degradation and loss, but little is known about how their species composition has changed. We recorded long-term vegetation change (from resurvey data) and examined the relationships with climate, pollutant deposition and grazing as key drivers of change, focusing on four forest types: pine, ash, acid- and base-rich oakbirch. All four forest types showed dynamic compositional change during 30–50 years between surveys, with increased species richness and decreased diversity. There was no evidence for homogenisation - the opposite was the case for all except pine (no change). Analyses indicate signiﬁcant and varied climate, pollution and grazing impacts; NHy deposition showed the most frequent association with species compositional changes. Notable species changes include increases in pteridophytes and declines in forb cover, and a doubling in frequency and cover of Fagus sylvatica between surveys. Our ﬁndings suggest a possible extinction debt, with many more species declining than increasing between surveys. This trajectory of change and our other ﬁndings indicate a pressing need for mitigation management to reduce the risks of future species losses, with forest expansion planning explicitly considering spatial location in relation to existing native forest and those plant species identiﬁed as most at risk.
