AB  - Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich ecosystems in temperate countries. These ecosystems suffered a high fragmentation process during the last century. Fragmentation can lead to the creation of an extinction debt in remaining habitat patches. In our study site, it was shown in a previous study that Fragmented habitat patches (area loss since 1965 >80%) exhibited an extinction debt in comparison to Stable habitat patches (area loss since 1965 <80%). However, human activities also created new habitat patches in the landscape and provided therefore opportunities for calcareous grassland plant species to colonize new sites. They also provide opportunities for studying species colonization abilities in the context of habitat restoration. We analyzed species richness in these new patches in comparison to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. When taking as reference Fragmented patches (that exhibit an extinction debt) or all old patches (Fragmented and Stable), we concluded to the occurrence of a colonization credit in New patches. However, when the reference is Stable patches (the less likely to exhibit an extinction debt) alone, no colonization credit could be detected. Moreover, correspondence analysis revealed that New patches were similar to old patches in term of species composition. These results are encouraging for restoration programs. They also showed that the presence of an extinction debt in reference habitats can lead to mistaken conclusion in restoration monitoring. Extinction debt occurrence should be taken into account in the choice of reference habitats for evaluation of restoration success.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich ecosystems in temperate countries. However, these ecosystems have suffered from fragmentation and destruction during the last century. We studied the response of calcareous grassland plant diversity to landscape changes in Belgium. Results indicated that high area loss (since 1965) old habitat patches exhibited an extinction debt inverse to low area loss old habitat patches, little depending on the area loss threshold (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%) considered for the distinction between the high and low area loss patches. However, human activities also created new habitat patches in the landscape and therefore provided opportunities for calcareous grassland plant species to colonize new habitats. This also provided opportunities to study species colonization abilities in the context of habitat restoration. We analyzed species richness in new patches compared to old patches in order to detect colonization credit. We detected the presence of a colonization credit in new patches when using high loss old patches (area loss>80%, exhibiting an extinction debt) or all old patches as a reference. However, when the reference was low loss old patches alone (area loss<80%, less likely to exhibit an extinction debt), no colonization credit was detected. In addition, species composition was similar between new patches and old patches. These results are encouraging for restoration programs. However, the results indicated that the presence of an extinction debt in reference habitats could lead to inaccurate conclusions in restoration monitoring. Therefore, extinction debt should be considered when choosing reference habitats to evaluate restoration success. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - Global climate change is already having an impact on species ranges. For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in 'extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and 'colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion.

AB  - Abstract ; A significant challenge in both measuring and predicting species extinction rates at global and local scales is the possibility of extinction debt, time-delayed extinctions that occur gradually following an initial impact. Here we examine how relative abundance distributions and spatial aggregation combine to influence the likely magnitude of future extinction debt following habitat loss or climate-driven range contraction. Our analysis is based on several fundamental premises regarding abundance distributions, most importantly that species abundances immediately following habitat loss are a sample from an initial relative abundance distribution and that the long-term, steady-state form of the species abundance distribution is a property of the biology of a community and not of area. Under these two hypotheses, the results show that communities following canonical lognormal and broken-stick abundance distributions are prone to exhibit extinction debt, especially when species exhibit low spatial aggregation. Conversely, communities following a logseries distribution with a constant Fisher's α parameter never demonstrate extinction debt and often show an “immigration credit,” in which species richness rises in the long term following an initial decrease. An illustration of these findings in 25 biodiversity hotspots suggests a negligible immediate extinction rate for bird communities and eventual extinction debts of 30–50% of initial species richness, whereas plant communities are predicted to immediately lose 5–15% of species without subsequent extinction debt. These results shed light on the basic determinants of extinction debt and provide initial indications of the magnitude of likely debts in landscapes where few empirical data are available.

AB  - Changes in species richness along the ecological succession gradient may be strongly determined by coexisting extinction debts of species from the original habitats and colonization credits of those from the replacing habitats. The magnitude of these processes and their causes remain largely unknown. We explored the extinction debt and colonization credit for grassland and forest specialist plants, respectively, and the local and landscape factors associated to the richness of these species groups in a 50-year process of forest encroachment into semi-natural Mediterranean grasslands. A set of sampling plots of persistent grasslands and forests and their transitional habitat (wooded grasslands) was selected within fixed-area sites distributed across the landscape. Our results confirm the extinction debt and suggest colonization credit (according to observed trends and model predictions) in wooded grasslands when compared to persistent forests, despite wooded grasslands and persistent forests having similar tree cover. Grassland connectivity and solar radiation had opposing effects on the richness of both grassland and forest specialists, and it is possible that the availability of seed sources from old forests may have accelerate the payment of colonization credit in the wooded grasslands. These results suggest that extinction debt and colonization credit have driven species turnover during the 50 years of forest encroachment, but at different rates, and that local and landscape factors have opposing effects on these two phenomena. They also highlight the importance of documenting biodiversity time lags following habitat change when they are still in progress in order to timely and adequately manage habitats of high conservation value such as the grasslands studied here.

AB  - International audience ; Habitat destruction is driving biodiversity loss in remaining ecosystems, and ecosystem functioning and services often directly depend on biodiversity. Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversity‐dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c. 2–21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversity‐dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

AB  - In many temperate regions worldwide, a large portion of deciduous forest grows on former agricultural land, while a smaller portion is ‘ancient’ forest on sites with no historical record of agricultural land use. The differences in species diversity between ancient and post-agricultural forests have been well documented. However, in regions where forest fragmentation occurred only a few centuries ago, it remains unclear whether these differences are due to an extinction debt in ancient forests (i.e., a delay in local species extinction), a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests (i.e., species are yet to colonize a patch), or both. Additionally, our knowledge on how soil conditions and landscape configuration interact with species’ traits to determine the colonization credit is limited. Here, we surveyed ancient and post-agricultural forest patches in NE Germany to quantify the magnitude of the colonization credit and identify its determinants. The colonization credit in an average forest patch amounted to 4.7 forest specialist species and ranged up to 9 species in highly isolated patches. In contrast, we found more species than predicted in patches better connected to ancient forests. The colonization credit was not smaller in older patches than it was in younger ones. Species with a low dispersal potential and a low seed output contributed most to the colonization credit. Our study demonstrates that in a landscape where the extinction debt has already been paid and only a small fraction of ancient forest is left, the recovery of forest specialist diversity in post-agricultural forests may take several centuries.

AB  - Habitat turnover concomitantly causes destruction and creation of habitat patches. Following such a perturbation, metapopulations harbor either an extinction debt or an immigration credit, that is the future decrease or increase in population numbers due to this disturbance. Extinction debt and immigration credit are rarely considered simultaneously and disentangled from the relaxation time (time to new equilibrium). In this contribution, we test the relative importance of two potential drivers of time‐delayed metapopulation dynamics: the spatial configuration of the habitat turnover and species dispersal ability. We provide a simulation‐based investigation projecting metapopulation dynamics following habitat turnover in virtual landscapes. We consider two virtual species (a short‐distance and a long‐distance disperser) and five scenarios of habitat turnover depending on net habitat loss or gain and habitat aggregation. Our analyses reveal that (a) the main determinant of the magnitude of the extinction debt or immigration credit is the net change in total habitat area, followed by species dispersal distance and finally by the post‐turnover habitat aggregation; (b) relaxation time weakly depends on the magnitude of the immigration credit or of the extinction debt; (c) the main determinant of relaxation time is dispersal distance followed by the net change in total habitat area and finally by the post‐turnover habitat aggregation. These results shed light on the relative importance of dispersal ability and habitat turnover spatial structure on the components of time‐delayed metapopulation dynamics.

AB  - Mountain plant species shift their elevational ranges in response to climate change. However, to what degree these shifts lag behind current climate change, and to what extent delayed extinctions and colonizations contribute to these shifts, are under debate. Here, we calculate extinction debt and colonization credit of 135 species from the European Alps by comparing species distribution models with 1576 re-surveyed plots. We find extinction debt in 60% and colonization credit in 38% of the species, and at least one of the two in 93%. This suggests that the realized niche of very few of the 135 species fully tracks climate change. As expected, extinction debts occur below and colonization credits occur above the optimum elevation of species. Colonization credits are more frequent in warmth-demanding species from lower elevations with lower dispersal capability, and extinction debts are more frequent in cold-adapted species from the highest elevations. Local extinctions hence appear to be already pending for those species which have the least opportunity to escape climate warming. ; ISSN:2041-1723

AB  - Although biodiversity crisis at different spatial scales has been well recognised, the phenomena of extinction debt and immigration credit at a crossing-scale context are, at best, unclear. Based on two community patterns, regional species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial abundance distribution (SAAD), Kitzes and Harte (2015) presented a macroecological framework for predicting post-disturbance delayed extinction patterns in the entire ecological community. In this study, we further expand this basic framework to predict diverse time-lagged effects of habitat destruction on local communities. Specifically, our generalisation of KH's model could address the questions that could not be answered previously: (1) How many species are subjected to delayed extinction in a local community when habitat is destructed in other areas? (2) How do rare or endemic species contribute to extinction debt or immigration credit of the local community? (3) How will species differ between two local areas? From the demonstrations using two SAD models (single-parameter lognormal and logseries), the predicted patterns of the debt, credit, and change in the fraction of unique species can vary, but with consistencies and depending on several factors. The general framework deepens the understanding of the theoretical effects of habitat loss on community dynamic patterns in local samples.

AB  - La pèrdua, fragmentació i transformació dels hàbitats representen una gran amenaça per a la biodiversitat en els ecosistemes terrestres d'arreu del món, desencadenant tant extincions com colonitzacions amb un resultat incert en la composició i la riquesa d'espècies.

Els estudis s'han dut a terme a les muntanyes del sud de Catalunya (nord-est de la Península Ibèrica), on la forestalització s'ha donat com a conseqüència de la reducció en la pastura durant la segona meitat del segle XX. Tot i que han passat més de 50 anys des de l'inici d'aquest procés de forestalització dels prats, s'ha detectat un important deute d'extinció per als especialistes de prat i crèdit de colonització per als especialistes de bosc.

Time lags of several decades, known as extinction debt and colonisation credit, often occur after land-use change events. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies addressing community assembly taking into account both extinction debt for habitat specialists of the former habitat and colonisation credit for habitat specialists of the new habitat. The aim of this thesis is, therefore, to address the drivers and mechanisms of time-lagged effects of habitat and landscape change on plant communities in semi-natural Mediterranean calcareous grasslands from a comprehensive approach, taking both changes in species richness and composition and their potential time lags into account. Extinction debt and colonisation credit are quantified after several decades of habitat change, and their drivers are investigated (Chapter 1). In order to disentangle the processes behind community change, the patterns and drivers of species extinctions and colonisations that already occurred are investigated through the two components of β-diversity: species replacement and richness differences (Chapter 2). Moreover, the role of plant traits in mediating extinctions of species of the former habitat (Chapter 3), and the population and individual-level mechanisms of extinction delay for one of the most frequent grassland specialists (Aphyllanthes monspeliensis; Chapter 4) are assessed after habitat change. The studies were conducted in the southern mountains of Catalonia (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), where forest encroachment occurred following grazing reduction during the second half of the 20th century. Although more than 50 years elapsed since the beginning of forest encroachment into these grasslands, both an important extinction debt for grassland specialists and colonisation credit for forest specialists are detected. Extinction debt was also confirmed for the grassland specialist A. monspeliensis, since its abundance depends on historical but not current connectivity. In addition, a rescue effect from surrounding grasslands and a slow vegetative and reproductive decay after habitat deterioration were identified as mechanisms enhancing extinction debt. Colonisation credit of forest plants, in turn, was probably maintained by dispersal limitation. Although species richness changed little after forest encroachment, high species replacement for the whole community occurred, resulting from idiosyncratic grassland specialists' extinctions and forest specialists' colonisations. However, while habitat fragmentation negatively affected some grassland specialists, no clear role of plant traits was found in mediating extinctions of this group. A generalised loss of grassland species and gain of forest species, resulting from the payment of extinction debt and colonisation credit, is expected to continue in the studied area even if no further forest encroachment occurs.

We compared composition of herbaceous plant species occurred between 1987-1991 and 2012-2013. In Ohyachi,eight species ofpteridophyte belonging to seven families and 40 species ofangiosperm belonging to 21 families became extinct. Manyoftheextinct species belonged to Brassicaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae. In Aoba-chuo, four species of pteridophyte (four families) and 22 species of angiosperm (13 families)became extinct. Many of the extinct species belonged to Asteraceae. In Ohyachiand Aoba-chuo,28angiosperm species (17families)and 32angiosperm species (18 families) immigrated, respectively. Many of the immigrated species in both Ohyachi and Aoba-chuo belonged to Asteraceae and Poaceae of angiosperm. Most of the immigrated species in both forests belonged to ruderal species or exotic species. Forest fragmentation occurred at 1958 in Ohyachi and at 1963 in Aoba-chuo. This study could verify that extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants occur 32-55 years after forest fragmentation in Ohyachi and 28-50 after in Aoba-chuo. This study will contribute to estimating date for accounting extinction debt and immigration credit of herbaceous plants in fragmented forests and to detecting the causes and the effects of them, which are required for the protection of herbaceous plants in urbanized areas of Sapporo.

AB  - Although human-driven landscape modification is generally characterized by habitat destruction and fragmentation, it may also result in the creation of new habitat patches, providing conditions conducive to spontaneous colonization. In this article, we propose the concept of ‘‘colonization credit’’ (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25–55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - Over the last years there is an increasing awareness that historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies may be important drivers for present-day species richness and biodiversity due to time-delayed extinctions or colonizations in response to historical environmental changes. Historically altered habitat patches may therefore exhibit an extinction debt or colonization credit and can be expected to lose or gain species in the future. However, extinction debts and colonization credits are difficult to detect and their actual magnitudes or payments have rarely been quantified because species richness patterns and dynamics are also shaped by recent environmental conditions and recent environmental changes. In this thesis we aimed to determine patterns of herb-layer species richness and recent species richness dynamics of forest herb layer plants and link those patterns and dynamics to historical land cover changes and associated land use legacies. The study was conducted in the Prignitz, NE-Germany, where the forest distribution remained stable for the last ca. 100 years but where a) the deciduous forest area had declined by more than 90 per cent (leaving only remnants of "ancient forests"), b) small new forests had been established on former agricultural land ("post-agricultural forests"). Here, we analyzed the relative importance of land use history and associated historical land cover changes for herb layer species richness compared to recent environmental factors and determined magnitudes of extinction debt and colonization credit and their payment in ancient and post-agricultural forests, respectively. We showed that present-day species richness patterns were still shaped by historical land cover changes that ranged back to more than a century. Although recent environmental conditions were largely comparable we found significantly more forest specialists, species with short-distance dispersal capabilities and clonals in ancient forests than in post-agricultural forests. Those species richness differences were largely contingent to a colonization credit in post-agricultural forests that ranged up to 9 species (average 4.7), while the extinction debt in ancient forests had almost completely been paid. Environmental legacies from historical agricultural land use played a minor role for species richness differences. Instead, patch connectivity was most important. Species richness in ancient forests was still dependent on historical connectivity, indicating a last glimpse of an extinction debt, and the colonization credit was highest in isolated post-agricultural forests. In post-agricultural forests that were better connected or directly adjacent to ancient forest patches the colonization credit was way smaller and we were able to verify a gradual payment of the colonization credit from 2.7 species to 1.5 species over the last six decades. ; In den vergangenen Jahren reift immer mehr die Erkenntnis, dass historische Landnutzungsveränderungen und deren Folgewirkungen einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die heutige Artenvielfalt und Biodiversität haben können. In Habitaten, deren Landnutzung und Fläche sich in historischer Zeit verändert hat kann aufgrund von verzögerten Aussterbe- und Einwanderungsprozessen eine erhöhte oder verringerte Artenvielfalt vorliegen, die nicht den heutigen Umweltbedingungen entspricht. Es liegen Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungs- bzw. Kolonisierungskredite vor, welcher über die Zeit mit Artverlusten oder Zugewinnen von Arten bezahlt werden. Aussterbeschulden oder Einwanderungskredite und deren Bezahlung sind schwierig zu ermitteln, da einerseits Informationen zu historischen Landnutzungsveränderungen oft fehlen und andererseits auch heutige Umweltfaktoren einen wichtigen Einfluss auf die Artenvielfalt haben. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es die heutigen Muster der Artenvielfalt von Waldbodenpflanzen in Laub- und Mischwäldern und deren Veränderungen über die letzten 60 Jahre zu ermitteln und diese Muster im Hinblick auf historische Landnutzungsveränderungen zu untersuchen. Das Studiengebiet umfasst große Teile der Prignitz (Brandenburg und angrenzende Teile von Sachsen-Anhalt), ein Gebiet, dessen Waldanteil sich in den letzten 100 Jahren kaum verändert hat, in dem sich jedoch seit dem Ende des 19ten Jahrhunderts der Anteil historisch alter Wälder (ohne historische nachgewiesene agrarliche Nutzung) um mehr als 90% reduziert hat, während an anderer Stelle wenige neue Wälder auf vorigen Agrarflächen etabliert wurden. Im Rahmen dieser Studie wurde zunächst die Artenvielfalt und deren aktuelle Veränderung in historisch-alten Wäldern und neu etablierten Wäldern untersucht und verglichen. Um den Einfluss von historischen Landnutzungsveränderungen auf die Artenvielfalt zu ermittlen, wurde die historische und heutige Vernetzung der Waldflächen analysiert, die Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten Wäldern und neu etablierten Wäldern verglichen und der Umfang und die Bezahlung der Aussterbeschulden und der Kolonisierungskredite ermittelt. Die Arbeit zeigt, dass historische Landnutzungsveränderungen die heutige Artenvielfalt noch immer beeinflussen. Obwohl die heutigen Umweltbedingungen in historisch-alten und neu etablierten Wäldern vergleichbar waren, war die Gesamtartenzahl in historisch-alten Wäldern signifikant höher und in diesen Wäldern wurden insbesondere mehr Waldspezialisten und sich nur über kurze Enfernung ausbreitende Pflanzenarten gefunden. Die Unterschiede in den Artenzahlen sind vor allem auf einen Kolonisierungskredit in neu etablierten Wäldern zurückzuführen, während die Aussterbeschulden in historisch-alten Wäldern weitgehend bezahlt wurden. Der Kolonisierungskredits war am höchsten in isoliert gelegenen Waldflächen und belief sich auf bis zu 9 Arten (im Mittel 4,7). Der Kolonisierungskredit in besser vernetzten und in direkt an historisch-alten Wäldern angrenzenden Flächen war deutlich geringer. In diesen Wäldern konnte eine Verringerung des Kolonisierungskredites von im Mittel 2,7 zu 1,5 Arten über die letzten sechs Jahrzehnte nachgewiesen werden.

AB  - Context : Hoverflies are often used as bio-indicators for ecosystem conservation, but only few studies have actually investigated the key factors explaining their richness in woodlands. Objectives : In a fragmented landscape in southwest France, we investigated the joint effects of woodland area, structural heterogeneity, connectivity and history on the species richness of forest-specialist hoverflies, and whether there was a time lag in the response of hoverflies to habitat changes, and tested the effect of spatiotemporal changes. Methods : Current species richness was sampled in 48 woodlands using 99 Malaise traps. Structural variables were derived from a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Old maps and aerial photographs were used to extract past and present spatial patterns of the woodlands since 1850. Relationships between species richness and explanatory variables were explored using generalized linear models. Results : We show that current habitat area, connectivity, historical continuity and the average density of tree-microhabitats explained 35 % of variation in species richness. Species richness was affected differently by changes in patch area between 1979 and 2010, depending on woodland connectivity. In isolated woodlands, extinction debt and colonization credit were revealed, showing that even several decades are not sufficient for hoverflies to adapt to landscape-scale habitat conditions. Conclusions : These findings emphasise the importance of maintaining connectedness between woodlands, which facilitates the dispersion in a changing landscape. Our results also highlight the benefits of using a change-oriented approach to explain the current distribution patterns of species, especially when several spatial processes act jointly. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - Mountain plant species shift their elevational ranges in response to climate change. However, to what degree these shifts lag behind current climate change, and to what extent delayed extinctions and colonizations contribute to these shifts, are under debate. Here, we calculate extinction debt and colonization credit of 135 species from the European Alps by comparing species distribution models with 1576 re-surveyed plots. We find extinction debt in 60% and colonization credit in 38% of the species, and at least one of the two in 93%. This suggests that the realized niche of very few of the 135 species fully tracks climate change. As expected, extinction debts occur below and colonization credits occur above the optimum elevation of species. Colonization credits are more frequent in warmth-demanding species from lower elevations with lower dispersal capability, and extinction debts are more frequent in cold-adapted species from the highest elevations. Local extinctions hence appear to be already pending for those species which have the least opportunity to escape climate warming.

AB  - The impact of habitat fragmentation and the success of habitat restoration were studied through a multi-taxonomic approach. The response to landscape structure and/or habitat quality of three taxonomic groups was explored, in (semi-)natural habitats. The three taxonomic groups were complementary, both in terms of their specific life history traits and their place in the food chain. We considered autotrophic species (vascular plants), herbivores (butterflies) and predators (spiders). Life-history traits and species specialization for target habitat were used to refine the analysis. Target habitat was a complex of wet heathlands, poor fens and bogs. Patches of this complex of habitats were sampled on two high plateaus in the Belgian Ardenne, the Plateau de Saint-Hubert and the Plateau des Tailles. Over the last 250 years, two jointly acting habitat dynamics were observed in these areas: a loss of area (and connectivity) on the one hand but also the creation of new habitat patches. It is precisely this double dynamics that enabled us to analyze and develop concepts linked to the response of species faced with spatio-temporal modifications of their habitat. Specifically, in this work we focused on the comprehension of two unbalanced situations, affecting the relationships between species richness and patch characteristics. A first unbalanced situation, the extinction debt, was observed for vascular plant communities. On the opposite, a colonization credit, the second unbalanced situation, was noted for butterflies and seemed to mainly affect specialist species. Specialist species of the three taxonomic groups showed relatively contrasted responses compared to generalist species. However, the life-history traits we studied only slightly influenced the response of species at the community level, excepted for pioneer communities in habitat patches less than 5 years old.

AB  - Although biodiversity crisis at different spatial scales has been well recognised, the phenomena of extinction debt and immigration credit at a crossing-scale context are, at best, unclear. Based on two community patterns, regional species abundance distribution (SAD) and spatial abundance distribution (SAAD), Kitzes and Harte (2015) presented a macroecological framework for predicting post-disturbance delayed extinction patterns in the entire ecological community. In this study, we further expand this basic framework to predict diverse time-lagged effects of habitat destruction on local communities. Specifically, our generalisation of KH’s model could address the questions that could not be answered previously: (1) How many species are subjected to delayed extinction in a local community when habitat is destructed in other areas? (2) How do rare or endemic species contribute to extinction debt or immigration credit of the local community? (3) How will species differ between two local areas? From the demonstrations using two SAD models (single-parameter lognormal and logseries), the predicted patterns of the debt, credit, and change in the fraction of unique species can vary, but with consistencies and depending on several factors. The general framework deepens the understanding of the theoretical effects of habitat loss on community dynamic patterns in local samples.

AB  - Aim: Past land use legacy effects – extinction debts and immigration credits – might be particularly pronounced in regions characterized by complex and dynamic landscape change. The aim of this study was to evaluate how current woody plant species distribution, composition and richness related to historical and present land uses. Location: A smallholder farming landscape in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1 ha sites in farmland, and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted versus permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognised conservation values, though apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in southwestern Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaic – similarly to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.

AB  - Context : Hoverflies are often used as bio-indicators for ecosystem conservation, but only few studies have actually investigated the key factors explaining their richness in woodlands. Objectives : In a fragmented landscape in southwest France, we investigated the joint effects of woodland area, structural heterogeneity, connectivity and history on the species richness of forest-specialist hoverflies, and whether there was a time lag in the response of hoverflies to habitat changes, and tested the effect of spatiotemporal changes. Methods : Current species richness was sampled in 48 woodlands using 99 Malaise traps. Structural variables were derived from a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Old maps and aerial photographs were used to extract past and present spatial patterns of the woodlands since 1850. Relationships between species richness and explanatory variables were explored using generalized linear models. Results : We show that current habitat area, connectivity, historical continuity and the average density of tree-microhabitats explained 35 % of variation in species richness. Species richness was affected differently by changes in patch area between 1979 and 2010, depending on woodland connectivity. In isolated woodlands, extinction debt and colonization credit were revealed, showing that even several decades are not sufficient for hoverflies to adapt to landscape-scale habitat conditions. Conclusions : These findings emphasise the importance of maintaining connectedness between woodlands, which facilitates the dispersion in a changing landscape. Our results also highlight the benefits of using a change-oriented approach to explain the current distribution patterns of species, especially when several spatial processes act jointly.

AB  - A central topic in nature conservation and ecological restoration is the potential of ecosystems to recover after the reduction of negative anthropogenic impacts. Often, protracted delays in biotic response to abiotic change have been observed. We analysed a unique long-term data series in Lake Fure, Denmark, spanning the transformation from pristine environmental conditions in the early 1900s through a period (1920–1970) of eutrophication – from accelerating sewage input of phosphorus (P) – and subsequent re-oligotrophication after sewage cleaning (1970–2015). We examine time delays between P inputs, in-lake P concentrations and the richness and composition of submerged macrophyte communities. Lake P concentration exhibited decade-long delays in response to periods of increasing or decreasing P inputs. It took 40 years and a 25-fold increase in P input before P concentrations suddenly took off in the 1960s, reflecting profound sediment accumulation. Following reduced P input from c. 1970, it took 5 years before P concentrations showed the first signs of a decline. In 2014, water P concentration was still markedly higher than in 1931, despite much lower P inputs, because of elevated sediment release. Fifty years of eutrophication led to a reduction in aquatic macrophyte richness from 36 species to 12. Species’ responses were closely related to their growth strategy and depth distribution. Deep-growing mosses, charophytes and short angiosperms disappeared, while tall angiosperms survived and pollution-tolerant macroalgae colonized and spread. Subsequently, 45 years of oligotrophication led to clearer waters, macrophyte richness recovering to 28 species and some charophytes and short angiosperms reappearing. Dominance of pollution-tolerant macroalgae persisted, however. Change in species dominance takes longer than colonization by new species. Synthesis. Time delays of P concentrations, water clarity and macrophyte richness and composition were long and complex. Neglecting growth strategies of species makes application of extinction debt and colonization credit concepts dubious, because numbers of oligotrophic species decrease and eutrophic species increase concomitantly during eutrophication and vice versa during oligotrophication. Although the original high species richness may be attained, it is unlikely that the original species composition is restored because many oligotrophic species have vanished from the regional species pool.

AB  - Les modèles de métapopulations permettent de prédire l'occupation des habitats au sein desquels elles évoluent en fonction de la configuration spatiale du paysage. La destruction et la création d'habitats peuvent induire une dette d'extinction ou un crédit d'immigration, c'est-à-dire des dynamiques d'espèces qui ne sont pas immédiates mais décalées dans le temps par rapport cette rotation des habitats. La présence d'un délai temporel signifie que les espèces ne sont pas à l'équilibre avec les paysages actuels. Cette thèse a pour objectif d'évaluer l'apport de modèles de métapopulations hors équilibre pour comprendre ces dynamiques décalées dans le temps de façon théorique et à partir de données empiriques sur les plantes forestières. A ces fins, nous avons évalué la robustesse d'une méthode d'inférence de paramètres de dynamique de métapopulations hors équilibre, adaptée à l'échelle régionale. Elle a ensuite été appliquée sur des données contemporaines de plantes forestières et de séries temporelles de cartographies des forêts dans les départements de la Seine-et-Marne et de l'Eure-et-Loir. A partir des modèles utilisés, nous avons pu reproduire certaines caractéristiques de la répartition des espèces qui sont dues à l'évolution historique des surfaces forestières. En effet, certaines espèces sont plus fréquentes en forêt anciennes et d'autres en forêt récentes, ce qui s'explique en partie par les traits des espèces et leurs affinités pour des conditions environnementales spécifiques. A partir de projections à long-terme de leurs dynamiques, nous avons montré que les délais de réponse de ces espèces peuvent être de plusieurs siècles et dépendent fortement de la connectivité fonctionnelle des habitats. Des scénarios virtuels de rotation des habitats ont été simulés pour pallier l'analyse des seules zones d'études. Associé à des projections de dynamiques de métapopulations, qui permettent de contrôler les paramètres à étudier, nous avons testé l'importance relative de la distance de dispersion des espèces et de la configuration spatiale de la rotation des habitats sur ces dynamiques. Le temps de retour à l'équilibre des métapopulations ne s'explique pas uniquement par l'amplitude de la dette d'extinction ou du crédit d'immigration mais dépend aussi de ces deux facteurs. Ces résultats mettent en évidence l'importance d'approfondir nos connaissances sur les effets de perturbations successives qui rendent le retour théorique à l'équilibre des espèces très incertain. ; Metapopulation models are used to predict the occupancy of habitats from landscape spatial configuration.

Such delays mean that species are not in equilibrium with the current landscape structures. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the contribution of non-equilibrium metapopulation models to understand time-delayed dynamics theoretically and from empirical datasets about forest plants. For this purpose, we assessed the robustness of the method used to infer metapopulation parameters at the regional scale. Then, we applied this method from contemporary plant inventories and time-series of forest maps of the Seine-et-Marne and the Eure-et-Loir french regions.

Indeed, some species are more frequent in ancient forests and some others are more frequent in recent forests notably due to species traits and their affinity for specific environmental characteristics. From long-term projections of species dynamics, we showed that the delays in forest plant dynamics are several centuries following habitat turnover and strongly depend on habitat functional connectivity. Virtual scenarios of habitat turnover were simulated to assess other study cases than the two study areas. We projected metapopulation dynamics, while controlling for some metapopulation parameters, to test the relative effects of species dispersal distance and the spatial configuration of habitat turnover on these dynamics. Metapopulation return time towards equilibrium not only depends on the magnitude of the extinction debt or on the magnitude of the immigration credit but also on these two variables.These results put forward the need to improve our knowledge on the effects of successive perturbations that make species return towards equilibrium unsure.

Metapopulation return time towards equilibrium not only depends on the magnitude of the extinction debt or on the magnitude of the immigration credit but also on these two variables.These results put forward the need to improve our knowledge on the effects of successive perturbations that make species return towards equilibrium unsure. ; Les modèles de métapopulations permettent de prédire l'occupation des habitats au sein desquels elles évoluent en fonction de la configuration spatiale du paysage. La destruction et la création d'habitats peuvent induire une dette d'extinction ou un crédit d'immigration, c'est-à-dire des dynamiques d'espèces qui ne sont pas immédiates mais décalées dans le temps par rapport cette rotation des habitats. La présence d'un délai temporel signifie que les espèces ne sont pas à l'équilibre avec les paysages actuels. Cette thèse a pour objectif d'évaluer l'apport de modèles de métapopulations hors équilibre pour comprendre ces dynamiques décalées dans le temps de façon théorique et à partir de données empiriques sur les plantes forestières. A ces fins, nous avons évalué la robustesse d'une méthode d'inférence de paramètres de dynamique de métapopulations hors équilibre, adaptée à l'échelle régionale. Elle a ensuite été appliquée sur des données contemporaines de plantes forestières et de séries temporelles de cartographies des forêts dans les départements de la Seine-et-Marne et de l'Eure-et-Loir. A partir des modèles utilisés, nous avons pu reproduire certaines caractéristiques de la répartition des espèces qui sont dues à l'évolution historique des surfaces forestières. En effet, certaines espèces sont plus fréquentes en forêt anciennes et d'autres en forêt récentes, ce qui s'explique en partie par les traits des espèces et leurs affinités pour des conditions environnementales spécifiques. A partir de projections à long-terme de leurs dynamiques, nous avons montré que les délais de réponse de ces espèces peuvent être de plusieurs siècles et dépendent fortement de la connectivité fonctionnelle des habitats. Des scénarios virtuels de rotation des habitats ont été simulés pour pallier l'analyse des seules zones d'études. Associé à des projections de dynamiques de métapopulations, qui permettent de contrôler les paramètres à étudier, nous avons testé l'importance relative de la distance de dispersion des espèces et de la configuration spatiale de la rotation des habitats sur ces dynamiques. Le temps de retour à l'équilibre des métapopulations ne s'explique pas uniquement par l'amplitude de la dette d'extinction ou du crédit d'immigration mais dépend aussi de ces deux facteurs. Ces résultats mettent en évidence l'importance d'approfondir nos connaissances sur les effets de perturbations successives qui rendent le retour théorique à l'équilibre des espèces très incertain.

AB  - En Europe tempérée, les paysages sont dominés par une mosaïque de forêts, prairies et cultures depuis plusieurs siècles. Cette longue période de temps a permis la spécialisation d'espèces au sein des habitats et de leurs interfaces grâce à de forts contrastes environnementaux. Cependant, de fréquents changements d'occupation du sol ont eu lieu par le passé, lesquels se sont accélérés dans les dernières décennies, remettant en cause la stabilité des communautés végétales et de leur environnement. L'afforestation d'anciennes prairies et l'extension de prairies par déforestation, le plus souvent issues de la progression et de la régression d'anciennes lisières, n'ont que peu été étudiées. Au sein des interfaces foret-prairie, en plus d'un effet lisière induit au sein de chaque habitat par la proximité de l'habitat adjacent, un effet histoire peut s'ajouter au sein des habitats récents, c'est-à-dire un héritage environnemental et/ou floristique (dette d'extinction, crédit de colonisation). Au sein des lisières d'habitats récents, une interaction entre effet lisière et effet histoire peut également être rencontrée. Dans cette thèse, les objectifs ont été d'évaluer l'influence relative de l'effet lisière et de l'effet histoire le long d'interfaces forêt-prairie stables, issues d'afforestation et issues de déforestation en s'intéressant (i) aux conditions environnementales, (ii) à la richesse et à la composition floristique des communautés végétales, et (iii) aux valeurs de traits au sein des communautés. Nos résultats ont montré des gradients croissants d'intensité lumineuse et de nutriments des sols allant des lisières aux cœurs de prairies. En réponse à ces gradients, un fort effet lisière sur la composition des communautés végétales a été trouvé en prairie. Ces différences floristiques entre lisières et cœurs de prairies s'expliquent par la présence d'un grand nombre d'espèces transgressives parmi les espèces spécialistes de forêt, lesquelles ont des valeurs de traits favorisant leur transgression en prairie. A côté de cela, une dette d'extinction d'espèces spécialistes de prairie a été trouvée au sein des forêts récentes, laquelle est responsable d'une hauteur végétative plus importante par rapport aux forêts anciennes. Ces résultats s'expliquent par une intensité lumineuse restée plus élevée au sein des forêts récentes, même après plusieurs décennies. Une dette d'extinction d'espèces spécialistes de forêt a aussi été mise en évidence en lisière de prairie récente, laquelle est le résultat d'une interaction entre effet lisière et effet histoire. En prairie récente, l'effet lisière favorise le maintien des espèces forestières. D'après nos résultats, les lisières de forêt et de prairie, dont la plupart ont subit un déplacement au cours des deux derniers siècles, hébergent de nombreuses espèces végétales spécialistes des habitats anciens, parfois en dette d'extinction. Une réévaluation de la distribution des espèces au sein des communautés végétales de forêts et prairies semble alors nécessaire en tenant en compte de l'histoire des habitats. Face à l'instabilité croissante des forêts et prairies, l'identification des espèces en dette d'extinction représente une chance pour la conservation et la restauration de la biodiversité végétale ; In temperate Europe, landscapes are dominated by a mosaic of forests, grasslands and crops since several centuries. This long period of time allowed the specialization of species within the habitats and their interfaces thanks to strong environmental contrasts. However, there have been frequent land-use changes in the past, which have accelerated in recent decades, challenging the stability of plant communities and their environment. The afforestation of former grasslands and the extension of grasslands by deforestation, mostly resulting from the progression and regression of the edges, have been poorly studied. In the forest-grassland interfaces, in addition to an edge effect induced in each habitat by the proximity to the adjacent habitat, a history effect can be added in recent habitats, i.e. an environmental and/or floristic legacy (extinction debt, colonization credit). In the recent habitat edges, an interaction between edge effect and history effect can also be encountered. In this thesis, the objectives were to evaluate the relative abundance of the edge effect and the history effect along forest-grassland interfaces stable, from afforestation process and from deforestation process, by studying (i) environmental conditions, (ii) the richness and floristic composition of plant communities, and (iii) trait values within communities. Our results showed increasing gradients of light intensity and soil nutrients ranging from grassland edges to grassland cores. In response to these gradients, a strong edge effect on the composition of plant communities was found in grasslands. These floristic differences between grassland edges and grassland cores are explained by the presence of a large number of transgressive species among the forest specialist species, which have trait values favoring their transgression in grasslands. Besides this, an extinction debt of grassland specialist species has been found in recent forests, which is responsible for a higher vegetative height compared to ancient forests. These results can be explained by the fact that light intensity remained higher in recent forests, even after several decades. An extinction debt of forest specialist species has also been demonstrated in the recent grassland edges, which is the result of an interaction between edge effect and history effect. In recent grasslands, the edge effect favors the maintenance of forest species. According to our findings, forest and grassland edges, most of which have been displaced over the past two centuries, are home to many plant species that are habitat specialists, sometimes in extinction debt. A re-evaluation of the distribution of species within forest and grassland plant communities then seems necessary, taking into account the history of habitats. In a context of increasing forests and grasslands instability, the identification of species in extinction debt represents an opportunity for the conservation and restoration of plant biodiversity

AB  - Degraded and secondary forests comprise approximately 50% of remaining tropical forest. Bird community characteristics and population trends in secondary forests are infrequently studied, but secondary forest may serve as a “safety net” for tropical biodiversity. Less understood is the occurrence of time-delayed, community-level dynamics such as an extinction debt of specialist species or a species credit resulting from the recolonization of forest patches by extirpated species. We sought to elucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities in secondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year period during the late breeding season and mid-winter. We classified birds caught in mist nets or recorded in point counts by residency status, and further grouped them based on preferred habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, conservation priority, foraging guild, and foraging strata. Using hierarchical, mixed-effects models we tested for trends among species that share traits. We found that permanent-resident species increased over time relative to migrants. In both seasons, primary forest species generally increased while species typical of secondary forest, scrub, or edge declined. Species relatively sensitive to habitat disturbance increased significantly over time, whereas birds less sensitive to disturbance decreased. Similarly, generalists with higher habitat breadth scores declined. Because, we found very few changes in vegetation characteristics in secondary forest patches, shifts in the avian community toward primary forest species represent a species credit and are likely related to vegetation changes in the broader landscape. We suggest that natural regeneration and maturation of secondary forests should be recognized as a positive conservation development of potential benefit even to species typical of primary forest.

AB  - Aim: Past land use legacy effects—extinction debts and immigration credits—might be particularly pronounced in regions characterized by complex and dynamic landscape change. The aim of this study was to evaluate how current woody plant species distribution, composition and richness related to historical and present land uses. Location: A smallholder farming landscape in south-western Ethiopia. Methods: We surveyed woody plants in 72 randomly selected 1-ha sites in farmland and grouped them into forest specialist, generalist and pioneer species. First, we investigated woody plant composition and distribution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Second, we modelled species richness in response to historical and current distance from the forest edge. Third, we examined diameter class distributions of trees in recently converted vs. permanent farmland. Results: Historical distance was a primary driver of woody plant composition and distribution. Generalist and pioneer species richness increased with historical distance. Forest specialists, however, did not respond to historical distance. Only few old individuals of forest specialist species remained in both recently converted and permanent farmlands. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that any possible extinction debt for forest specialist species in farmland at the landscape scale was rapidly paid off, possibly because farmers cleared large remnant trees. In contrast, we found substantial evidence of immigration credits in farmland for generalist and pioneer species. This suggests that long-established farmland may have unrecognized conservation values, although apparently not for forest specialist species. We suggest that conservation policies in south-western Ethiopia should recognize not only forests, but also the complementary value of the agricultural mosaic—similar to the case of European cultural landscapes. A possible future priority could be to better reintegrate forest species in the farmland mosaic.

AB  - Abstract: Biodiversity loss occurring in mountain ecosystems calls for integrative approaches to improve monitoring processes in the face of human-induced changes. With a combination of vegetation and remotely-sensed time series data, we quantitatively identify the responses of land- cover types and their associated vegetation between 1987 and 2016. Fuzzy clustering of 11 Landsat images was used to identify main land-cover types. Vegetation belts corresponding to such land- cover types were identified by using species indicator analysis performed on 80 vegetation plots. A post-classification evaluation of trends, magnitude, and elevational shifts was done using fuzzy membership values as a proxy of the occupied surfaces by land-cover types. Our findings show that forests and scrublands expanded upward as much as the glacier retreated, i.e., by 24% and 23% since 1987, respectively. While lower alpine grassland shifted upward, the upper alpine grassland lost 10% of its originally occupied surface showing no elevational shift. Moreover, an increase of suitable sites for the expansion of the subnival vegetation belt has been observed, due to the increasing availability of new ice-free areas. The consistent findings suggest a general expansion of forest and scrubland to the detriment of alpine grasslands, which in turn are shifting upwards or declining in area. In conclusion, alpine grasslands need urgent and appropriate monitoring processes ranging from the species to the landscape level that integrates remotely-sensed and field data.

AB  - Aim To identify the effect of multiple, temporally close, forcing events (i.e. climate‐driven habitat fragmentations/homogenizations) in shaping current patterns of biodiversity in alpine areas. Given their spatial configuration, alpine areas have been traditionally seen as islands surrounded by an “ocean” of unsuitable lands. A quantitative assessment of the effects of Holocene climate fluctuations on islands area and inter‐island connectivity is crucial to finely reconstruct past biodiversity dynamics and forecast species responses to future changes. Location Italy. Taxa Carabidae (Ground beetles), Chrysomelidae (Leaf beetles), Elateridae (Click beetles), Orthoptera (Grasshoppers and Crickets) and Papilionoidea (Butterflies and Skippers). Methods A total of 1,077 species for 128,093 records were analysed and a classification based on their functional traits allowed identifying groups of good and poor dispersers within each taxon. A dynamic discrete model of ecosystem evolution provided the spatio‐temporal context to test two competing (transient equilibria vs. nonequilibrium) dynamics based on different colonization capabilities. In the transient equilibria dynamic the species are able to respond to island evolution through successful dispersal and colonization events, whereas in the nonequilibrium dynamic ineffective immigration constrains the current species richness to that generated by the strongest island contraction. Results With the exception of Elateridae, good dispersers (Chrysomelidae and Papilionoidea) responded to environmental changes by establishing a series of transient equilibria. In contrast, the nonequilibrium dynamic better described patterns of species richness in poor dispersers (Carabidae and Orthoptera). Main conclusions Our approach could be used as the basis for the development of spatially and temporally explicit models of island evolution and could be a valuable tool for quantifying the sensitivity of single taxa to climate‐driven habitat changes. It also represents a further step towards the forecasting of future responses to climate change and the accompanying development of conservation strategies that more effectively respond to the detrimental impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

AB  - Evidence indicating that ecological communities show delayed responses to environmental change has raised the need to better understand the effects of landscape history on biodiversity. We investigated how freshwater biodiversity is related to both recent and past land use change in tropical river catchments. More specifically, we analysed the relationship between biodiversity and change in forest cover that occurred across five decades, including landscape trajectories of forest gain and loss. The abundance of stream insects showed a more delayed response to landscape change than rarefied richness, whereas the Tsallis diversity index was not related to past forest cover. However, both alpha diversity and local abundance were related to mean forest cover across the five decades when conditioned by the trajectory of change. We found a negative relationship between the historical mean of forest cover and community descriptors in streams embedded in landscapes on a trajectory of forest loss, but a positive relationship in landscapes on a trajectory of forest gain. We provide the first evidence of delayed responses of tropical freshwater insect communities to landscape history and suggest that the magnitude of change in forest cover, mediated by its trajectory, is a major driver of delayed responses. We show that a trajectory of forest loss might result in both immediate loss of species and a set of species doomed for future extinction. Synthesis and applications. Delayed responses of multispecies communities to past landscape changes depend on their extent, frequency and intensity. Our findings indicate that, beyond the relative amount of forest cover within river catchments, the magnitude of change in forest cover mediated by its historical trajectory can be a major driver of delayed responses in stream communities. We suggest that, if biodiversity conservation is the main aim, stream restoration should be prioritized in catchments with higher forest cover, as even under a forest gain trajectory, stream communities continue responding to past landscape changes depending on how widespread and intensive changes were.

AB  - Ecological restoration is expected to reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5–10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration. ; published version ; peerReviewed

AB  - Questions Many Western European and North American countries have been experiencing strong reforestation in the last two centuries due to agricultural abandonment. Other land‐use changes, such as urbanization, can simultaneously trigger forest erosion. In this context of habitat turnover, forest understorey plant dynamics depend on the balance between immigration credit in post‐agricultural forest and extinction debt in ancient forest. The transient and final community properties following concomitant habitat creation and destruction are poorly known. In this contribution, we study the projected transient regional forest plant dynamics and identify the determinants of the relaxation duration at both landscape and patch scales. Location Seine‐et‐Marne region, France. Methods Species' incidences are projected in 9,208 patches of the Seine‐et‐Marne region characterized by strong development of post‐agricultural forests and a moderate erosion of ancient forests during the period 1840-2000. We use a metapopulation model with static biodiversity data and landscape history to project forest plant dynamics. We focus on 33 generalist forest species that are able to colonize both ancient and post‐agricultural forests. Results Our analyses reveal that (1) extinction in ancient forests slows the colonization process, which lasts between 250 and 990 years after habitat turnover, depending on species characteristics; (2) the species incidence in post‐agricultural forests converges towards that in ancient forests long before the overall species incidence stabilizes at the landscape scale (i.e. long before the relaxation time); (3) landscape‐ and patch‐scale relaxation times depend on species colonization ability and patch functional connectivity; (4) the colonization process is rather slow for ancient forest species; and (5) the incidence of ancient forest species becomes larger than the incidence of other species at the end of the colonization dynamics thanks to their strong persistence. Conclusions Ancient forest species may potentially benefit from a large immigration credit but need centuries to use it. On such time scales, many perturbations are likely to jeopardize the realization of this potential credit.

AB  - The human population growth in many parts of the world causes a rising demand for resources. This often induces deforestation, resulting in small forest relicts embedded in a human-modified landscape consisting of agricultural fields, exotic tree plantations, and settlements. The Taita Hills (Kenya), which was the study area for this doctoral research, is a prime example of these processes. The tree species composition and structure was inventoried in the twelve remaining forest relicts, the exotic plantations, and the matrix. With these data we quantified the remaining biodiversity, the related ecosystem services, and the potential for restoration actions. First, the indigenous forest relicts were studied. Four forest communities were defined, including two (i.e. Millettia-Craibia and Chrysophyllum-Strombosia) with typically late successional tree species and two (i.e. Phoenix-Maesa and Tabernaemontana), which consisted mainly of early-successional species. We suggest that the species composition of the larger forest relicts, where all four communities were found, resembles the historical or natural state. The occurrence of the Phoenix-Maesa or Tabernamontana community was restricted to forest edges and the smaller forest relicts. These relicts can be defined as hybrid ecosystems due to the absence of late successional species. Such hybrid ecosystems differ from the historical species composition, but still hold the potential to be restored with adapted management measures. We found the larger forest relicts, on higher altitudes, further away from the forest edges and on sites with low human disturbance to be significantly more biodiverse. In these forest relicts, we also analysed the reproductive success of the tree species. The forest regeneration determines future forest structure and composition, but is often severely hampered in degraded forests. The extinction debt, recruitment, and colonization credit was quantified for each forest relict and on landscape level based on the co-occurrence of tree species in the seedling, sapling or mature tree layer. On landscape level, the potential extinction debt was 9% of the regional species pool. This corresponds with seven species likely to become extinct in the Taita Hills. On the scale of a forest relict, several species were absent in the upper canopy layer while they did occur in the regeneration layer. This recruitment credit was three and six species for the large and small forest relicts, respectively, while the potential extinction debt was twelve and four species respectively. Circa 20% of all tree species in a forest relict were threatened by extinction. The conservation value of the smaller forest relicts was higher than expected because of the relatively high recruitment credit, which even included late-successional species. In the second part, the role of exotic tree plantations for biodiversity conservation was studied. Therefore, the regeneration of indigenous and exotic species was measured in plantations dominated by Pinus patula, Eucalyptus saligna, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea robusta or Acacia mearnsii. Regeneration of indigenous species, even late-successional species, was relatively higher in Grevillea plantations. The other plantation types had a significantly lower performance, partly due to the invasive character of the dominant species. In the third part, solitary trees were studied in the human-modified landscape. In total, 65 tree species were observed (63% of these were indigenous). A non-random distribution of tree traits was observed in the landscape. For instance, more exotic tree species occurred on croplands where they may deliver marketable products or services, play a role in nitrogen fixation or can be used in agroforestry systems. The indigenous species also delivered multiple products or ecosystem services, but no other services than exotic species. The matrix clearly functions as a refuge for a subset of the indigenous tree species and becomes a place for domestication and preservation of useful species. Future changes in key social and ecological drivers are expected and ecosystem service trade-offs may arise. For instance, the loss of local knowledge on indigenous plant species can result in a replacement of indigenous species by exotics. Faced with the challenges of demography and poverty, the area of cultivated land is increasing worldwide and the production of goods and services is intensified and enhanced. Within intensified systems, indigenous tree species are at risk due to several, non-exclusive reasons. Especially the conservation of late-successional tree species in these landscapes is precarious, because they are restricted to the forest interior of large forest relicts. In contrast, early-successional species seem to persist throughout the landscape. These pioneer trees can catalyse all production processes, both cultivated and natural, while they also diminish the pressure on the remaining forest relicts. The protection of the remaining indigenous forest relicts, combined with the enlargement of secondary forest, for instance by conversion of exotic plantations, and the protection of the solitary trees in the matrix is necessary for the protection of the regional biodiversity and the ecosystem services they deliver. nheemse bosrelicten, boomplantages en de landbouwmatrix. Zij verzekeren de permeabiliteit van de matrix of kunnen de omvorming van exotische boomplantages versnellen, terwijl ze verschillende ecosysteemdiensten kunnen leveren aan de lokale bevolking. Het voorbestaan van climaxboomsoorten is echter precair en enkel gewaarborgd binnen grote bosrelicten waar menselijke verstoring minimaal is. Het behoud van de inheemse bosrelicten of het uitbreiden ervan, bijvoorbeeld door de omvorming van exotische plantages, met het behoud van de vele solitaire bomen in de matrix, is noodzakelijk om de biodiversiteit en haar geleverde ecosysteemdiensten te behouden. ; status: published

AB  - 1. Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. 2. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (ca. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities’ extinction debt. 3. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. 4. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. 5. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlights areas where such conservation activities should be implemented.

AB  - Destruction and fragmentation of (semi-) natural habitats are considered the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Plant species may exhibit a slow response to fragmentation, resulting in the development of an extinction debt in fragmented plant communities. The detection of extinction debt is of primary importance in habitat conservation strategies. We applied two different approaches proposed in the literature to identify extinction debt in Southeast Belgium calcareous grasslands. The first method compared species richness between stable and fragmented habitat patches. The second explored correlations between current species richness and current and past landscape configurations using multiple regression analyses. We subsequently examined results generated by both methods. In addition, we proposed techniques to identify species that are more likely to support extinction debt and associated functional traits. We estimated a respective extinction debt of approximately 28% and 35% of the total and specialist species richness. Similar results were obtained from both methods. We identified 15 threatened specialist species under the current landscape configuration. It is likely the landscape configuration no longer supports the species habitat requirements. We demonstrated that non-clonal species are most threatened, as well as taxa that cannot persist in degraded habitats and form only sparsely distributed populations. We discussed our results in light of other studies in similar habitats, and the overall implications for habitat conservation. ; Peer reviewed

AB  - Context Hoverflies are often used as bio-indicators for ecosystem conservation, but only few studies have actually investigated the key factors explaining their richness in woodlands. Objectives In a fragmented landscape in southwest France, we investigated the joint effects of woodland area, structural heterogeneity, connectivity and history on the species richness of forest-specialist hoverflies, and whether there was a time lag in the response of hoverflies to habitat changes, and tested the effect of spatiotemporal changes. Methods Current species richness was sampled in 48 woodlands using 99 Malaise traps. Structural variables were derived from a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Old maps and aerial photographs were used to extract past and present spatial patterns of the woodlands since 1850. Relationships between species richness and explanatory variables were explored using generalized linear models. Results We show that current habitat area, connectivity, historical continuity and the average density of tree-microhabitats explained 35 % of variation in species richness. Species richness was affected differently by changes in patch area between 1979 and 2010, depending on woodland connectivity. In isolated woodlands, extinction debt and colonization credit were revealed, showing that even several decades are not sufficient for hoverflies to adapt to landscape-scale habitat conditions. Conclusions These findings emphasise the importance of maintaining connectedness between woodlands, which facilitates the dispersion in a changing landscape. Our results also highlight the benefits of using a change-oriented approach to explain the current distribution patterns of species, especially when several spatial processes act jointly.

AB  - Questions : What are the patterns of plant communities in terms of richness and floristic composition along stable forest-grassland interfaces? Are there specific species at the edge and/or specialist species transgressions between adjacent habitats? How does edge displacement following land-use change alter distance-to-edge plant diversity patterns? What are the relative influences of the edge effect and the edge displacement in forests and grasslands? Location: Forests and grasslands in northeast France. Methods : Floristic surveys were conducted in three types of forest-grassland interface, which can be stable or the result of edge displacements due to afforestation or deforestation. The sample comprised a total of 132 plots in 22 forest-grassland interfaces. Point-biserial correlation coefficients were used to classify the species into several groups in stable interfaces: forest, edge or grassland specialists and generalists. Using LMMs and Tukey's HSD tests, the total species richness and that of each species group were compared between the plot positions (i.e. distance-to-edge) and between the stable interfaces and cases of afforestation and deforestation. To evaluate the relative influence of the edge effect (plot position) and edge displacement (afforestation/deforestation) on plant community composition, CCAs and variation partitionings were performed. Results : The largest difference in both plant community richness and composition was found between the forest and grassland edges. The highest species richness was found at the grassland edges. In addition to a high number of generalist species, a mixture of forest and grassland specialist species were predominant at the edges, and the forest specialists were almost the only transgressive species. Afforestation interfaces showed an extinction debt of grassland and edge specialist species and a colonization credit of forest specialists in recent forests. The effects of edge displacement were larger than those of the edge effect in forests, and the opposite was observed in the grasslands. Conclusions : Forest and grassland plant communities differ strongly even over very short distances. However, the edges host a large number of forest and grassland specialist species, which explain higher species richness than in adjacent habitats. This results from interactive effects of distance-to-edge and edge displacement following land-use change.

AB  - Ecological restoration is expected to reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5–10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration. ; peerReviewed

AB  - Apesar da vasta literatura sobre os efeitos da perda e fragmentação florestal sobre a biodiversidade, poucos estudos incorporaram o aspecto temporal, ou seja, a história da paisagem, em suas análises. No entanto, o histórico de alterações da paisagem é um dos fatores que, ao ser ignorado, pode levar a interpretação errada dos reais efeitos da perda e fragmentação florestal sobre a diversidade de espécies. Assim, o objetivo desta tese foi avaliar os efeitos do histórico de mudança da paisagem sobre aves e pequenos mamíferos na Mata Atlântica. Para atingir este objetivo eu investiguei (1) a dinâmica de três paisagens fragmentadas de Mata Atlântica entre 1960-1980 e 1980-2000, (2) os efeitos da cobertura florestal passada e atual sobre a riqueza de espécies de espécies e, (3) a plausibilidade de modelos de cobertura vegetal nativa na riqueza de espécies e abundância, considerando ou não a heterogeneidade da vegetação nativa. Para investigar essas questões, foram usados dados de aves e pequenos mamíferos em 53 fragmentos florestais localizados em três paisagens com diferentes proporções de cobertura florestal (10, 30 e 50%) na Mata Atlântica do Planalto Atlântico de São Paulo. Os resultados mostraram que (1) a trajetória da cobertura florestal entre os anos 1960 e 2000 nas três paisagens estudadas foi não-linear e, atualmente, fragmentos florestais consistem de um mosaico de florestas com diferentes idades de regeneração, (2) a existência do débito de extinção e do crédito de espécies, assim como o potencial para o seu pagamento futuro, depende não só da trajetória de cobertura florestal, mas também da cobertura florestal remanescente na escala da paisagem, e (3) a heterogeneidade da vegetação nativa desempenha um papel importante na definição da riqueza de espécies e abundância e que as respostas a essa heterogeneidade são definidas pelos requerimentos de habitat e dependem de cobertura florestal da paisagem. ; Despite the extended literature on the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on biodiversity, few studies incorporated the temporal aspect, i.e. the history of change of habitat amount and configuration over time at a given landscape, in the analysis. However, ignoring landscape change history might lead to inaccurate interpretation of the impact of forest loss and fragmentation on species diversity. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of landscape change history on birds and small mammals in the Atlantic Forest. To achieve this aim I investigated (1) the land-use and land-cover change dynamics in Atlantic Forest fragmented landscapes between 1960s-1980s and 1980s-2000s, (2) the effects of historical and present-day forest cover on species richness and, (3) the potential of explaining species richness and abundance patterns by inclusion or exclusion of present native vegetation heterogeneity in model frameworks. To address these objectives I used data on birds and small mammals in 53 forest fragments from three landscapes with different proportions of forest cover (10, 30 and 50%) in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The results showed that (1) forest cover trajectory between the 1960s and 2000s at the three study landscapes was non-linear and that individual forest patches currently consist of a mosaic of different forest age classes, (2) the existence of extinction debt and species credit as well as the potential for their future payment depends not only on forest cover trajectory but also on the present amount of remaining forest cover at the landscape scale, and (3) the heterogeneity within native vegetation plays an important role in defining species richness and abundance in fragmented landscapes and responses to this heterogeneity are defined by habitat requirements and depend on forest cover at landscape scale.

AB  - (trad auto)Metapopulation models predict the occupancy of the habitats in which they occur as a function of the spatial configuration of the landscape. The destruction and creation of habitats can induce a debt of extinction or an immigration credit, i.e. species dynamics that are not immediate but delayed in time in relation to this habitat rotation. The presence of a time delay means that the species are not in equilibrium with the current landscapes. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the contribution of out-of-equilibrium metapopulation models to understand these time-shifted dynamics theoretically and based on empirical data on forest plants. To this end, we evaluated the robustness of a method for inferring out-of-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics parameters, adapted to the regional scale. It was then applied to contemporary data on forest plants and time series of forest maps in the departments of Seine-et-Marne and Eure-et-Loir. From the models used, we were able to reproduce some characteristics of the distribution of species that are due to the historical evolution of forest areas. Indeed, some species are more frequent in old-growth forests and others in recent forests, which is partly explained by the characteristics of the species and their affinity for specific environmental conditions. From long-term projections of their dynamics, we have shown that the response times of these species can be several centuries and are highly dependent on the functional connectivity of habitats. Virtual habitat rotation scenarios were simulated to compensate for the analysis of the study areas alone. Associated with projections of metapopulation dynamics, which make it possible to control the parameters to be studied, we tested the relative importance of the dispersion distance of species and the spatial configuration of habitat rotation on these dynamics. The time to return to metapopulation equilibrium is not only explained by the magnitude of the extinction debt or immigration credit, but also depends on these two factors. These results highlight the importance of deepening our knowledge of the effects of successive disturbances that make the theoretical return to species equilibrium highly uncertain. / Les modèles de métapopulations permettent de prédire l'occupation des habitats au sein desquels elles évoluent en fonction de la configuration spatiale du paysage. La destruction et la création d'habitats peuvent induire une dette d'extinction ou un crédit d'immigration, c'est-à-dire des dynamiques d'espèces qui ne sont pas immédiates mais décalées dans le temps par rapport cette rotation des habitats. La présence d'un délai temporel signifie que les espèces ne sont pas à l'équilibre avec les paysages actuels. Cette thèse a pour objectif d'évaluer l'apport de modèles de métapopulations hors équilibre pour comprendre ces dynamiques décalées dans le temps de façon théorique et à partir de données empiriques sur les plantes forestières. A ces fins, nous avons évalué la robustesse d'une méthode d'inférence de paramètres de dynamique de métapopulations hors équilibre, adaptée à l'échelle régionale. Elle a ensuite été appliquée sur des données contemporaines de plantes forestières et de séries temporelles de cartographies des forêts dans les départements de la Seine-et-Marne et de l'Eure-et-Loir. A partir des modèles utilisés, nous avons pu reproduire certaines caractéristiques de la répartition des espèces qui sont dues à l'évolution historique des surfaces forestières. En effet, certaines espèces sont plus fréquentes en forêt anciennes et d'autres en forêt récentes, ce qui s'explique en partie par les traits des espèces et leurs affinités pour des conditions environnementales spécifiques. A partir de projections à long-terme de leurs dynamiques, nous avons montré que les délais de réponse de ces espèces peuvent être de plusieurs siècles et dépendent fortement de la connectivité fonctionnelle des habitats. Des scénarios virtuels de rotation des habitats ont été simulés pour pallier l'analyse des seules zones d'études. Associé à des projections de dynamiques de métapopulations, qui permettent de contrôler les paramètres à étudier, nous avons testé l'importance relative de la distance de dispersion des espèces et de la configuration spatiale de la rotation des habitats sur ces dynamiques. Le temps de retour à l'équilibre des métapopulations ne s'explique pas uniquement par l'amplitude de la dette d'extinction ou du crédit d'immigration mais dépend aussi de ces deux facteurs. Ces résultats mettent en évidence l'importance d'approfondir nos connaissances sur les effets de perturbations successives qui rendent le retour théorique à l'équilibre des espèces très incertain.

AB  - Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas where such conservation activities should be implemented. ; Fil: Semper Pascual, Asunción. Universität zu Berlin; Alemania ; Fil: Macchi, Leandro.

AB  - A new model of delayed species loss (extinction debt) within isolated communities is applied to a large data set of terrestrial vertebrate assemblages (n = 188) occupying habitat fragments or islands varying greatly in size and age. The model encapsulates previous approaches based on diversity-dependent (DD) extinction rates while allowing for a more flexible treatment of temporal dynamics. Three important results emerge. First, species loss rate slows down with the age of the isolate, a strong and general pattern largely unnoticed so far. Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms. Thirdly, a simple diversity-independent model based on area (converted into population size) and age explains 97% of the variability in species loss rate and appears to be a promising predictive tool to handle extinction debt following habitat loss.

AB  - Habitat destruction, often caused by anthropogenic disturbance, can lead to the extinction of species at an unprecedented rate. It is important, therefore, to consider habitat destruction when assessing population viability. Another factor often ignored in population viability analysis, is the Allee effect that adds to the risk of populations already on the verge of extinction. Understanding the Allee effect on species dynamics and response to habitat destruction has intrinsic value in conservation prioritization. Here, the Allee effect was considered in a multi-species hierarchical competition model. Results showed that species persistence declines dramatically due to the Allee effect, and certain species become more susceptible to habitat destruction than others. Two extinction orders emerged under habitat destruction: either the best competitor becomes extinct first or the best colonizer first. The extinction debt and order, as well as the time lag between habitat destruction and species extinction, were found to be determined by species abundance and the intensity of the Allee effect. ; Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology

AB  - Aim: Local extinction after habitat modifications is often delayed, leading to an extinction debt. Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate. Location: Bonga, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia. Methods: We studied 50 trees that had been isolated for periods ranging from a few years to half a century after clearing. The trees were now located in the agricultural landscape at different distances from intact Afromontane forests. Fourteen trees in the forests were used as references. Each tree was inventoried for all vascular epiphytic plants, mosses and liverworts. Results: Time since clearance had a direct negative effect on number of forest specialist species via delayed extinctions and the detected large extinction debt of both bryophytes and vascular plants continued to be paid over several decades. However, time since clearance had an indirect positive effect on number of forest indicator species via the reappearance of shade from coffee planted surrounding the trees, even if the waiving effect on the extinction debt was rather small. Additionally, trees at further distances from the forest edge had fewer forest-associated species. Main conclusions: Our results show that the ability of agroecological landscapes to foster forest biodiversity may be overestimated if meta-community processes over time and space are not taken into account. However, the possibility of initiating counteracting processes that modify the level of expected local extinctions should be evaluated more often to find ways of improving conditions for biodiversity in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - 1. Habitat loss leading to smaller patch sizes and decreasing connectivity is a major threat to global biodiversity. While some species vanish immediately after a change in habitat conditions, others show delayed extinction, that is, an extinction debt. In case of an extinction debt, the current species richness is higher than expected under present habitat conditions. 2. We investigated wetlands of the canton of Zürich in the lowlands of Eastern Switzerland where a wetland loss of 90% over the last 150 years occurred. We related current species richness to current and past patch area and connectivity (in 1850, 1900, 1950, and 2000). We compared current with predicted species richness in wetlands with a substantial loss in patch area based on the species‐area relationship of wetlands without substantial loss in patch area and studied relationships between the richness of different species groups and current and historical area and connectivity of wetland patches. 3. We found evidence of a possible extinction debt for long‐lived wetland specialist vascular plants: in wetlands, which substantially lost patch area, current species richness of long‐lived specialist vascular plants was higher than would have been expected based on current patch area. Additionally and besides current wetland area, historical area also explained current species richness of these species in a substantial and significant way. No evidence for an extinction debt in bryophytes was found. 4. The possible unpaid extinction debt in the wetlands of the canton of Zürich is an appeal to nature conservation, which has the possibility to prevent likely future extinctions of species through specific conservation measures. In particular, a further reduction in wetlands must be prevented and restoration measures must be taken to increase the number of wetlands.

AB  - Abstract ; Following habitat fragmentation individual habitat patches may lose species over time as they pay off their “extinction debt.” Species with relatively low rates of population extinction and colonization (“slow” species) may maintain extinction debts for particularly prolonged periods, but few data are available to test this prediction. We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land-use history from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, to test for an extinction debt in relation to species-specific extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presence–absence of 36 plant species were first parameterized using data from Lincolnshire, where forest cover has been relatively low (∼5–8%) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory, for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant, where forest cover was reduced from ∼25% to <10% between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5%). As a consequence, the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus, more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover.

We analyzed two unusually detailed data sets on forest plant distributions and land-use history from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, to test for an extinction debt in relation to species-specific extinction and colonization rates. Logistic regression models predicting the presence–absence of 36 plant species were first parameterized using data from Lincolnshire, where forest cover has been relatively low (∼5–8%) for the past 1000 years. Consistent with extinction debt theory, for relatively slow species (but not fast species) these models systematically underpredicted levels of patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant, where forest cover was reduced from ∼25% to <10% between 1775 and 1900 (it is presently 6.5%). As a consequence, the ability of the Lincolnshire models to predict patch occupancy in Vlaams-Brabant was worse for slow than for fast species. Thus, more than a century after forest fragmentation reached its current level an extinction debt persists for species with low rates of population turnover.

AB  - The extinction debt, delayed species extinctions following landscape degradation, is a widely discussed concept. But a consensus about the prevalence of extinctions debts is hindered by a multiplicity of methods and a lack of comparisons among habitats. We applied three contrasting species–area relationship methods to test for plant community extinction debts in three habitats which had different degradation histories over the last century: calcareous grassland, heathland and woodland. These methods differ in their data requirements, with the first two using information on past and current habitat area alongside current species richness, whilst the last method also requires data on past species richness. The most data‐intensive, and hence arguably most reliable method, identified extinction debts across all habitats for specialist species, whilst the other methods did not. All methods detected an extinction debt in calcareous grassland, which had undergone the most severe degradation. We conclude that some methods failed to detect an extinction debt, particularly in habitats that have undergone moderate degradation. Data on past species numbers are required for the most reliable method; as such data are rare, extinction debts may be under‐reported.
